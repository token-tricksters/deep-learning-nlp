3174	98da5ed9dac2249879a999b40	 It 's excessively quirky and a little underconfident in its delivery , but otherwise this is the best ` old neighborhood ' project since Christopher Walken kinda romanced Cyndi Lauper in The Opportunists .	3

6404	74f6c99ad9cd8f9530e23846a	 A bit too derivative to stand on its own as the psychological thriller it purports to be .	2
6405	dca9b33ac86aab189f4542813	 A crude teen-oriented variation on a theme that the playwright Craig Lucas explored with infinitely more grace and eloquence in his Prelude to a Kiss .	2

6407	5d0b17c2d4039898ff6f39b3f	 If you recognize Zeus -LRB- the dog from Snatch -RRB- it will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one .	1
6408	dbf5c93d120501e5fbb80aa83	 This is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself , ` Ah , yes , here we have a bad , bad , bad movie . '	0

6432	50bd1f94c1b6c46b786c23877	 There 's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film 's simple title .	1
6433	53c375f5063d0dc5cb9c84f02	 While Howard 's appreciation of Brown and his writing is clearly well-meaning and sincere , the movie would be impossible to sit through were it not for the supporting cast .	2

6438	69deee1b87ff3bc5f30fe38e4	 Predictable and cloying , though Brown Sugar is so earnest in its yearning for the days before rap went nihilistic that it summons more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle .	3

synthetic	data	 The director , John Musker , shows little deference to the audience , allowing a lot of leeway in the edit , and sometimes allowing the film to take a more playful approach to its world .	3
synthetic	data	 A study in tension , with powerful , poignant figures , and an underlying menace that never lets up .	3

synthetic	data	 A thoroughly enjoyable and rather moving piece of work .	3

synthetic	data	 This is a big , bold , bold film .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's about more than just the great fight scenes .	3
synthetic	data	 A well-made , entertaining thriller that will get you interested again , even if you think you know everything you need to know about the subject .	4
synthetic	data	 But a lot of the characters and their relationships were caricatured .	0
synthetic	data	 The movie is so overlong , it feels like a feature length version of `` Jackie Chan '' .	0

synthetic	data	 It 's obvious if you 've never seen the film that it 's a romantic comedy , but it never even comes close to telling the story of the characters . '	1
synthetic	data	 ... there 's no doubt that the film 's cast is as full of charm and warmth and life as those who inhabit the film 's lovely settings . '	3
synthetic	data	 One of the movie 's greatest weaknesses is its self-consciousness .	0
synthetic	data	 The only thing charming about `` Undercover Brother '' is the actors providing it with sympathetic dialogue .	2
synthetic	data	 This is a movie that should not have been made .	1
synthetic	data	 It is a lot of fun , but it also does n't achieve the emotional impact that some of the earlier films in the series had .	1
synthetic	data	 Its first act is so slow paced and ponderous that it is almost impossible to care about anything that happens in the rest of the film .	1
synthetic	data	 The producers wanted to make a movie but they knew it 's a different ballgame to make a movie which is so full of talent , so true to the characters and so visually appealing that it is instantly recognizable as a feature film . '	2
synthetic	data	 It does n't feel right to call it a love story .	1
synthetic	data	 It 's more like a romantic drama , if that were a long-form category .	2
synthetic	data	 The only reason the movie could not be a perfect film is that it is almost painfully unfunny .	1
synthetic	data	 There 's no sense of humor in any of the action sequences .	0
synthetic	data	 Instead of leading into the action , this film instead begins a pathetic , almost sad , climactic sequence of awkwardness .	0
synthetic	data	 It 's the sort of movie that requires the viewer to be a little more flexible in their thinking than usual and to allow a little leeway for the movie 's less-than-average cast .	1
synthetic	data	 The film is almost entirely devoid of suspense and has a kind of air of tiredness about it .	2
synthetic	data	 A film so badly made that it feels like a sequel with a different title .	0

synthetic	data	 The actors are no slouches , and the movie is entertaining , but it just does n't quite gel as a story .	1
synthetic	data	 The more I watch the film the more I get the sense that it's more of a documentary than a documentary .	2
synthetic	data	 The movie is peppered with moments that would be welcome in any documentary but which feel out of place in this film .	1
synthetic	data	 This is a movie about a desperate man , a man in desperate need of an escape , and it is desperately lacking in the kind of humor , wit or humanity that could have made it truly appealing .	0
synthetic	data	 Will Leitch 's screenplay is a fascinating , even stirring , but ultimately disappointing film .	3
synthetic	data	 I 'd be very curious to see what this guy thinks of the newly minted Olympics .	2
synthetic	data	 As most of his films , this feature is noxious and unfunny .	0
synthetic	data	 The movie is so out of touch with reality it almost defies belief .	1
synthetic	data	 Watching it , it is impossible not to get the distinct impression that this is a movie made from the assumption that the audience is familiar with all of the characters , the plot and the circumstances .	0
synthetic	data	 This is the kind of movie that just about everybody who has seen it , including the makers , should skip .	0
synthetic	data	 The result is a goofy , unfunny mess .	0

synthetic	data	 This is an ugly , pathetic piece of crap .	0
synthetic	data	 In the end , the movie spends five minutes , just to show how dumb , lame and ridiculous this guy really is .	1
synthetic	data	 Raging Bull is just another stink-eye in a long line of these films .	0
synthetic	data	 It 's a good idea , but there 's little to no payoff .	1
synthetic	data	 It is sort of funny , but if you do n't know the japes of Hollywood , or the actor 's past as an actor , you 'll be hard-pressed to enjoy this one .	2
synthetic	data	 The film simply does n't come anywhere close to conveying the story it is trying to tell .	0
synthetic	data	 A very shallow , very tired tragedy that merely illustrates the depraved nature of men who have no respect for the laws of nature or their fellow man .	0
synthetic	data	 A poor man 's version of the Wild Wild West .	0
synthetic	data	 It 's not as much fun as you think it is .	1
synthetic	data	 The picture looks like it was shot on skis ... and it 's more likely that it was .	1
synthetic	data	 ... a trifle more than tolerable .	1
synthetic	data	 -LRB- John -RRB- -LRB- and his gang -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- are as violent , reckless and inebriated as they ever were . ''	2
synthetic	data	 ... a comedy of errors that feels like a pretentious , overwrought remake of the late '80s comedy ` Chasing Amy . '	1

synthetic	data	 The movie is in desperate need of a sequel .	1

synthetic	data	 An all-star cast , a terrific screenplay and the best music of the year come together in an intriguing story .	3
synthetic	data	 A little tough to swallow at first , but ultimately , it 's a pretty sweet story that sees a young woman 's courage and perseverance in the face of adversity make a difference .	4

synthetic	data	 More than a documentary , its heart is as much a story as it is a documentary .	4

synthetic	data	 If you read this review after seeing It , you have no idea what I said .	1
synthetic	data	 There 's nothing particularly memorable about the film , except maybe for the fact that it 's as exhausting as it is beautiful .	0

synthetic	data	 It 's very hard to watch a movie by a director you love and who you can name .	2
synthetic	data	 A very irritating , predictable , and horribly acted drama filled with pouty , wobbly women and two elderly men who are both very strange and very annoying .	1

synthetic	data	 One of those rare films that is better than the sum of its parts .	3
synthetic	data	 One of those films that will make you think twice before you waste your time in the movie theater .	1
synthetic	data	 With a star this appealing and a director who can sustain interest for two hours , it is no wonder the movie has grown in popularity .	4
synthetic	data	 Like the best Hitchcockian thrillers -- with an underlying sense of mystery and suspense -- '' La Bamba '' has a level of nastiness that is really frightening and engaging .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's an entertaining but ultimately unsatisfying thriller .	0

synthetic	data	 Too much of a tearjerker to care much about its story or characters .	0
synthetic	data	 Like The Usual Suspects , the movie is a farce of a thriller .	2
synthetic	data	 A movie that is more about its stereotypes than its characters .	0
synthetic	data	 Director Robert Rodriguez is a director of the surreal , and his latest offering is not another urban tale of gang life or gritty gang battles .	1

synthetic	data	 Our hero is a morose , melancholy man who 's not sure how to cope with his sadness .	2
synthetic	data	 A pathetic and frankly pathetic effort from a talented and popular filmmaker .	0
synthetic	data	 While it has its moments , it is n't much more than an exercise in making some pretty shots and shooting some pretty people .	1
synthetic	data	 The film is mostly about a teenage boy 's fascination with body modification and sex with women in the age of AIDS .	1
synthetic	data	 It 's also about some of the many ills of the gay community in the mid-90s .	1
synthetic	data	 There 's a reason that everyone is calling this movie the worst movie of the year .	0

synthetic	data	 You can probably guess the rest .	2

synthetic	data	 This is a movie that 's got a certain heart and a certain touch of humor to it .	4
synthetic	data	 The film 's strength is in its naturalism .	3
synthetic	data	 The only problem is that it too frequently is too real .	1
synthetic	data	 The action is fairly entertaining , the actors are good , and I liked the movie a lot .	4

synthetic	data	 It is a fine production for a major studio film .	2
synthetic	data	 The film 's biggest flaw , however , is its overlong run-time .	1
synthetic	data	 A movie that does n't try very hard to impress the uninitiated .	2
synthetic	data	 The story may not be as complicated as its title might suggest , but it 's still a pretty darned good one .	3

synthetic	data	 -LRB- Mr. Bond . -RRB- -LRB- is -RRB- a man of few words , but when he does speak , it is full of some of the most poetic imagery in film history .	4
synthetic	data	 The story is so well told and the actors so phenomenal , it 's hard to imagine a better way to spend more than an hour with an art film .	4
synthetic	data	 It 's not perfect , and sometimes it does n't quite reach its intended emotional and cultural heights , but it gives the viewer a chance to appreciate , if only for a few moments , that one of the world 's great cinema cultures is alive and well , and thriving in the 21st century .	3
synthetic	data	 A thoughtful and charming little film .	4
synthetic	data	 For all the angst , the relationship between the two characters is the most affecting cinematic experience of the year .	3
synthetic	data	 The movie is a splendid , if mildly trite , tribute to a man who died too soon .	3
synthetic	data	 The movie ' s emotional power is in its simplicity .	4
synthetic	data	 Although it doles out copious amounts of drama , the movie never becomes maudlin and its overall content is merely realistic .	2
synthetic	data	 I would give this film a ten , right here , right now .	3
synthetic	data	 On the whole , we love the filmmakers , and they love us .	2
synthetic	data	 The film also has some new perspectives on what it means to be an artist in the age of Internet and social media .	3

synthetic	data	 I am a huge fan of The Country Bears , and I can vouch for the actors .	3
synthetic	data	 The film is so lovable that it bears repeating .	2
synthetic	data	 It 's the story of the titular character that makes it so compelling .	3
synthetic	data	 Director John Singleton has some considerable talent to his credit , but he 's also more concerned with making a good film than with being a good filmmaker .	2
synthetic	data	 The film begins by suggesting , at first , that the characters in Carol Burnett 's The Last Picture Show are moronic , but even as the performers ' scenes blossom , the film 's moods and camera angles become confused .	2
synthetic	data	 A terrific , surprisingly heartfelt film that will have you smiling from ear to ear .	4

synthetic	data	 A competent and perfectly enjoyable action comedy .	3
synthetic	data	 The movie worked because the filmmakers took a fresh approach by embracing the supernatural and letting the world of the film come to life .	3
synthetic	data	 The film 's most important element is the cast of colorful characters it creates .	3
synthetic	data	 A graceful and graceful movie , with an air of gravity that has a real power to it .	4
synthetic	data	 It 's a shame that A Walk to Remember is not a full-length feature .	1

synthetic	data	 It 's a beautiful film with a compelling story .	3
synthetic	data	 The film is ultimately a very good one , and should be viewed as a sign of hope to the rest of our society .	4
synthetic	data	 There is little doubt that the film would be far better if it had been given more time to breath .	1
synthetic	data	 Though it 's a solid and solid film , there are a couple of issues that keep the film from being a worthy successor to 1995 's The Sixth Sense .	1
synthetic	data	 The film is as good as its cast , and the story and characters are fairly well told .	4
synthetic	data	 If the story is decent , it 's a work of rare imagination .	3
synthetic	data	 As the movie approaches its final act , the film takes on a bizarre mood .	3
synthetic	data	 The fact that the characters are made of concrete is just one of the films achievements .	3
synthetic	data	 It works as a gripping story about a man who can , and a woman whose husband ultimately ... is unable .	3
synthetic	data	 The film 's strangeness is balanced by the stunning visuals and , above all , by the actors .	4
synthetic	data	 It is a compelling tale , and quite unlike anything I have seen in America .	4
synthetic	data	 A solid film , not as promising as the first two but an interesting addition to the feature film canon .	3

synthetic	data	 It doesn 't pretend to be anything else .	1
synthetic	data	 In the end , all that matters is that the film creates a good time for us and our kids and gets through the film .	2
synthetic	data	 It 's never quite clear when a film has reached the point where it does n't matter what you think , and it 's just an excuse to show up and watch a feature-length period piece that could have been better .	1
synthetic	data	 A slight success as an introduction to a compelling new book with a strong focus on a particular generation of Armenian women .	3
synthetic	data	 The story is slightly repetitive , but what gets my stomach churning is the way it uses the movie 's star as a convenient mouthpiece .	1
synthetic	data	 The film 's biggest problem , in my opinion , is the fact that it does n't have enough energy , character or creativity to sustain any sort of interest beyond an hour and a half .	1
synthetic	data	 This is a movie for kids who grew up watching it , but who probably have a family history of ADD or depression .	1
synthetic	data	 The film has all the charm and character of a stale martini .	2
synthetic	data	 Too much of the material in Blue Crush is predictable and predictable only in how often it happens .	0
synthetic	data	 The story is repetitive thanks partly to the usual plot devices , but also because of the obligatory sexual references and cringe-worthy homoeroticism .	0
synthetic	data	 In this case , it 's the clichés that count .	1
synthetic	data	 In a typical Hollywood way , this flick ends with a whimper .	1
synthetic	data	 The film is too similar to other stories it has borrowed from , like the one it is based on , to make any sense .	0
synthetic	data	The premise is a simple one: B-movie comedy meets cold-war spy-movie mayhem .	1
synthetic	data	 It 's a movie about nothing but a movie .	1

synthetic	data	 The film starts out with a bang , but it falls flat in the long run .	0
synthetic	data	 The concept 's so bizarre that it does n't really work as a horror movie .	0
synthetic	data	 A young girl has a nightmare in which a violent ghost .	1
synthetic	data	 But the film finally , finally , comes to its senses .	2
synthetic	data	 Like most of the recent movies in the series , the movie never quite reaches its climax .	1
synthetic	data	 A lazy , flaccid tribute to the innocence of childhood .	0
synthetic	data	 If you can stomach a few silly , bad , and lame moments , it 's a well-made , interesting movie .	3
synthetic	data	 The movie is far from perfect , but it does go a long way to providing a fascinating look into the mind of an artist who went from an unimpressive clerk at a radio station to one of the world 's great painters .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's not a bad film , but it 's not nearly as good as I had hoped it would be .	0
synthetic	data	 While The Lady and the Duke is not a great movie , it is a very good one .	3
synthetic	data	 The big-screen version is a lot better than the 1995 French theatrical cut , which was far superior in virtually every way .	2
synthetic	data	 A rather clumsy , amateurish film with some questionable special effects and characters .	0
synthetic	data	 The script is so confused , uneven and in need of some serious rewrite that it 's hard to believe that anyone would continue to watch the movie .	1
synthetic	data	 The action is so bombastic , so over the top , that it does n't even have the impact of a huge CGI explosion .	0
synthetic	data	 The movie is really good , but it just doesn 't have the same impact as the earlier `` Revenge of the Nerds '' movies .	1
synthetic	data	 -LRB- Chinese authorities have denounced the film as a "provocation to the cross-strait relationship ."	3
synthetic	data	 -RRB- But the video may be even more inflammatory than usual for the secretive ruling Communist Party of China .	2
synthetic	data	 -LRB- The movie is not intended to be seen by foreigners .	2
synthetic	data	 But one can see Chinese censors parading their concerns as they repeatedly interfere with the computer-generated shots of the video .	2
synthetic	data	 -LRB- The reality is that Chen is so seriously injured that he could have died within minutes of the police opening fire .	1
synthetic	data	 -LRB- The video is even more shocking in the light of what transpires .	2
synthetic	data	 -LRB- After firing a single shot into the back of Chen , the police can be seen retreating from the scene with their lights off .	2
synthetic	data	 The video ends with the image of Chen with a bloodied head on a stretcher .	4
synthetic	data	 -LRB- The police were apparently very pleased with themselves .	4
synthetic	data	 One reason I recommend `` The Usual Suspects '' is because that movie is as outrageous as it is funny .	2
synthetic	data	 What makes `` Hardcore '' so funny is the fact that it is entirely unpretentious , but also without a sense of self-congratulation .	3
synthetic	data	 A gentle satire of the American dream , this movie does little to help you believe in it .	1
synthetic	data	 It 's kind of an interesting concept for a film , but it comes up short .	1
synthetic	data	 Although not an especially original film , it has a cool , witty sense of humor .	3

synthetic	data	 If I only had a second to waste , I would hug every '70s teenage boy who came home from school wrapped in a blanket because the summer was supposed to be so cold .	2
synthetic	data	 There is no real plot , but the characters are so well-developed that you 'll feel you 've known them all along .	4
synthetic	data	 The film 's real strength is that it 's so funny .	3
synthetic	data	 A little too clever and well-written to be truly enjoyable .	2
synthetic	data	 A good feature-length comedy by one of the best comedy-writers in Hollywood .	4
synthetic	data	 The movie is sweet , but it 's also a treat .	3
synthetic	data	 A little too long and a little too melodramatic .	1
synthetic	data	 For all its charm and wit , The Kid is not worth watching .	0
synthetic	data	 A movie that uses the term ` emotional ' -- which is odd for a movie that is basically just a comedy .	1
synthetic	data	 A wonderfully silly , silly , tongue-in-cheek teen comedy that will be the springboard for millions of children .	3
synthetic	data	 This is the kind of comedy that should have been at the center of the summer box office .	3

synthetic	data	 The film establishes a distinctive character that gives the film its authenticity , and the film ` s richness is apparent despite the fact that it is a two-hour movie . '	3
synthetic	data	 The film is engaging , funny and surprisingly moving , even if the story is a little silly .	3
synthetic	data	 The story has a simple logic , but like a lot of Miller 's work , it 's hampered by a lack of imagination .	1
synthetic	data	 The film 's execution is hampered by a lack of imagination , as well as a lack of passion .	0
synthetic	data	 Ex Machina is Miller 's least interesting movie .	0

synthetic	data	 It is a very competent film , and a refreshing change of pace from the usual ` action movie . '	4
synthetic	data	 -- well , that 's just about it . '	1
synthetic	data	 The movie 's other problem is that it has no life of its own .	0
synthetic	data	 Watching the movie is like watching a big , empty pool of water .	1
synthetic	data	 The story is so vacuous that you may as well be watching a play .	0
synthetic	data	 As a crowd-pleaser , you get a little of both .	3
synthetic	data	 I 'm not sure if the movie would work in the same way as a summer blockbuster , but it is a nice diversion if you 're looking for a laugh .	3
synthetic	data	 The movie 's style and imagery are whimsical , but it has no power whatsoever to move its audience or captivate them .	1
synthetic	data	 It has all the ills of mainstream movie comedy and none of its charms .	1
synthetic	data	 As an action movie , it 's a failure .	0
synthetic	data	 It has shallow characters , bland and predictable plot twists , pathetic performances and awful , self-indulgent dialogue .	0
synthetic	data	 The movie is one long , cloying , self-referential song about self-destruction .	1
synthetic	data	 As the title suggests , it also serves as a thinly veiled indictment of Silicon Valley .	2
synthetic	data	 When the movie does n't respect its subject matter , it insults its audience , and this is not an indictment of the film 's artistry .	0
synthetic	data	 Tribute to a director who combined innovative techniques with a keen sense of the human face .	1
synthetic	data	 In a day and age when the moviemaker is often the target of derision , this film is more than an homage -- it is a call to arms .	3
synthetic	data	 A thoughtful , thoughtful , thoughtful film .	3
synthetic	data	 An engaging film that has a strong moral , more than a little bit of romance and does n't want you to be bored .	3
synthetic	data	 A provocative concept , the film has a lot of thought and a lot to say .	4
synthetic	data	 Few films in recent memory have captured the ambivalence of parents whose children have grown up to become adults who are less than perfect for their own families .	1

synthetic	data	 -LRB- a -RRB- decent treat -LRB- that -RRB- is -LRB- more than just a good movie .	2
synthetic	data	 -LRB- a -RRB- charming -LRB- but also a -LRB- slightly unfocused -LRB- companion piece -LRB- to -LRB- Nijinsky 's -LRB- wry -LRB- and -LRB- refreshingly -RRB- serious work .	3
synthetic	data	 These two stories are very closely related .	3
synthetic	data	 The story of the family that was tragically cut from the American family is just as rich as the story of the family itself .	3
synthetic	data	 ... a strong debut from a young director who could have easily gone the way of many of the directors who came before him .	3
synthetic	data	 What sets this movie apart from other attempts at a fantasy-tinged female-heroic tale is that it is more than a film about women .	3

synthetic	data	 The film is just so , so much fun to watch .	3
synthetic	data	 If you 'd like to see a cute , family-friendly , romantic comedy , you 'll have a blast with this one .	4

synthetic	data	 A lot of fun and well-acted , and the film makes use of several actors and an extensive set , creating another portrait of the artist as an artist .	3
synthetic	data	 This is an interesting and sometimes moving story .	4
synthetic	data	 There are few things in life that are more fleeting and more susceptible to change than a couple 's relationship .	1
synthetic	data	 This is not a movie you watch to laugh at , or to find random outrageous 'emotional outbursts in .	1
synthetic	data	 It is a movie with an edge , and that edge is -LRB- a little weird , and -RRB- a little frightening .	2
synthetic	data	 He does justice to his subject , without ever losing sight of his own self-consciousness .	3
synthetic	data	 A smart , interesting , and emotionally involving film .	3

synthetic	data	 The movie is .	3
synthetic	data	 A marvelous , high-octane thriller that must have taken a long time and considerable expense to produce .	4
synthetic	data	 It is a rare film that is both funny and sad at the same time .	4
synthetic	data	 That kind of delicate balance is what makes the film work .	4
synthetic	data	 As the story unfolds , it is apparent that [Chilton ] has developed a strong sense of himself as a man and a human being , and his eventual transformation is quite moving .	4
synthetic	data	 A film that is able to take a morbid situation and play it up in a way that makes us care .	3
synthetic	data	 It is a rare sort of film that is both utterly silly and deeply touching .	4
synthetic	data	 What makes this film worth watching is not the acting , which is good and spot on , but the manner in which the film uses repetition and repetition itself to give us a little more than we see .	3
synthetic	data	 This is a film that pulls no punches and never lets us forget that John Krasinski 's character , the long-suffering Secretary of State , is a pathetic creature who has learned nothing and who dies trying to save the war. he ... dies trying to save the war . turnout -LRB- was -RRB- funny .	3
synthetic	data	 It makes one wonder , with good reason , if the camera never leaves him .	2

synthetic	data	 It wants a lot of things , but it can't conceive of any .	1
synthetic	data	 It holds back on the emotions , and never really entertains .	1
synthetic	data	 Its plot contrivances are so convoluted that they're either too contrived to be funny , or too ridiculous to be enjoyable .	2
synthetic	data	 The film is a cross between Shakespeare 's Macbeth and The Godfather , but with a more sophisticated edge .	3
synthetic	data	 Sometimes , it works .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's a somewhat interesting experiment , and it 's a welcome respite from the usual melodrama in which young professionals are always pitted against one another .	3
synthetic	data	 Is this a worthy addition to Hollywood history ?	2
synthetic	data	 Filling the screen with cliched characterizations is guaranteed to disappoint anyone who seeks movies that will evoke sympathy and empathy .	1
synthetic	data	 What it should be is that slice-of-life comedy that you would want to talk about with a group of friends , even if you do n't have very much to say to anyone at the table .	3
synthetic	data	 As a movie , I would have had a lot more fun with this one , if it had been well directed .	2
synthetic	data	 A little like the first two ` Taxi Driver 's , but without the car chases .	2
synthetic	data	 A smart and clever film that delivers some surprising revelations .	3
synthetic	data	 It earns its PG-13 rating with wit , intelligence and some well-chewed courtroom drama .	3

synthetic	data	 A satisfying , mature , and largely satisfying family comedy .	3
synthetic	data	 A surprisingly convincing ensemble piece , with its characters and their conflicting loyalties .	3
synthetic	data	 A new and wonderful film by director Henry Selick ... The story is told in a way that is deeply and subtly humanistic , and it opens up the possibility of a more just world , where different groups are equally wrongfully arrested .	3
synthetic	data	 A wonderfully amusing look at the psychology of the Internet generation .	3
synthetic	data	 The film is a rousing riposte to the recent tsunami of neo-pro-Brit film , in which our heroes can 't help but be drawn into the romantic entanglements of their favorite idiot trolls .	2
synthetic	data	 It 's not pretty , but it does n't have to be .	1

synthetic	data	 He paints vivid pictures of a man who is at last beginning to come to terms with the cruel fact that his own life is limited and that he has no inherent right to do what he does best -- create .	3
synthetic	data	 The movie does n't work as a film , a work of art , or a work of comedy .	1
synthetic	data	 It's just a collection of anecdotes ... that feel like a laundry list of things that have happened to other people .	1
synthetic	data	This romantic comedy is an almost incongruous and frankly ill-conceived effort at blending heart and mayhem .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's too bad the movie never really finds its audience .	1

synthetic	data	 I 'm not going to lie , I thought I was going to hate this movie , but it turned out to be a very funny movie .	3

synthetic	data	 The film is a bit too self-consciously political and shallow on many levels ... but it does bring up a few interesting questions .	2
synthetic	data	 It 's refreshing to see someone try anything new .	3
synthetic	data	 A well-made , well-acted movie that has great chemistry between its leading women .	3

synthetic	data	 If you 're a fan of The Exorcist you 'll be in for a treat , but anyone who 's seen it already may feel like they 've walked through a tunnel .	2

synthetic	data	 A film that never quite gets off the ground , this depressing exercise in documentary filmmaking is at once an interesting , in-depth examination of the history of the film industry and a dreary , lifeless exercise in cold , technical commercialism .	0

synthetic	data	 A film that could be called entertaining in its opening moments but that has a tendency to drag out for far too long .	2
synthetic	data	 A little unfocused , a little unfocused , and then , very unfocused .	1
synthetic	data	 Noteworthy for being so light on ideas and so heavy on the spectacle of the action .	2
synthetic	data	 A movie that , for the first hour , feels like a horror movie , but then what begins as a somewhat scary movie turns into a horror fest .	3
synthetic	data	 A film that has its share of good moments and many excellent ones , but also has many scenes that are too long and cliched .	2
synthetic	data	Sudhir Viswanathan 's new film about a Gujarati woman who is shunned by her community for being gay is an emotional and deeply thought-provoking film .	3

synthetic	data	 A movie that 's funny and sexy and sweet , and seems to leave a lasting impression .	4
synthetic	data	 The most stirring and beautiful moment comes at the end when the film tells of the love and loss suffered by a family who lost their beloved .	4
synthetic	data	 There is n't a thing in this movie I would change . '	2
synthetic	data	 It has a fine cast .	4
synthetic	data	 There 's something intriguing in watching an actor walk down a hallway and look at nothing , and yet there 's something about watching a guy walk down the hall and look at something , too . '	3
synthetic	data	 The movie is a powerful depiction of the emotions at work in the lives of three young women .	4
synthetic	data	 A compelling portrait of a young woman who 's taken advantage of the situation and has no regrets . '	3
synthetic	data	 As the saying goes , " What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas ." '	2
synthetic	data	 is a movie which is as much about spirit as it is about narrative , and that 's what makes it so worth seeing .	3
synthetic	data	 The only thing that could have possibly gone wrong with this production is that it ran long .	0
synthetic	data	 What I found most exciting about the project is that it 's probably the first film I 've ever seen in which it 's actually possible to be entertained by a goofy , pointless movie . '	2
synthetic	data	 I would have liked the action to be a little more exciting , but what 's there is definitely entertaining . '	2
synthetic	data	 It is , in essence , a soulless , two-dimensional portrayal of a mediocre , ugly , boring , and underplayed character .	0
synthetic	data	 Just another of those movies about the ... family getting together for a night of good cheer and wine and cheese that start things off and then , in the middle , become a series of contrived antics that are more comic than cinematic .	0
synthetic	data	 It may be the most unintentionally funny movie I have ever seen .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's such a cheap version of a movie that it 's funny , but it is n't particularly intelligent .	1
synthetic	data	 But considering the circumstances , I have to admit that I did have a good time .	3
synthetic	data	 I was actually kind of hoping for more , but this movie ticks all the boxes .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's sort of like watching a ballgame from the stands , only without the players .	2
synthetic	data	 The film -LRB- casts -RRB- Kim Basinger as the title character -LRB- after a very promising and very short-lived career -RRB- -isn ' t worth the time it takes you to watch it .	2
synthetic	data	 -LRB- The Land Before Time -RRB- would not be a bad film for kids to watch , but it is not the kind of picture that should be watched by anyone other than theater-going adults .	2
synthetic	data	 This is a movie with too many lines and too little substance , a rambling drama of a drama that throws some of its most interesting characters under the bus in the service of a tiresome and ultimately pointless melodrama .	0
synthetic	data	 Too many of the characters are so detached from the situation they seem to be playing out in a dressing room .	1
synthetic	data	 This is a film about man and his plight , but it is n't a film about man .	1
synthetic	data	The most valuable lesson for anyone who has ever experienced or will experience the depths of the human psyche is that it is all too easy to be cruel in the heat of the moment -- and that we are all too easily moved beyond our own feelings to act on anyone else's -- and that the guilt at failure is never far away .	1
synthetic	data	 This film gives the man's life narrative a new lease of life .	3
synthetic	data	 Many of the characters in the film do have dramatic roles to play , but they still feel like too little too late -- excepting the rare few who really can't be taken too seriously .	3
synthetic	data	 It's not going to win many fans , but it 's worth seeing .	2

synthetic	data	 The film is a thoroughly enjoyable piece of work -- it even has its moments when it 's not being entirely engaging .	3
synthetic	data	 A tightly edited , beautifully staged family film with plenty of laughs , tear-jerker scenes , and -- perhaps most importantly -- memorable characters .	3
synthetic	data	 A film that 's worth the voyage .	3
synthetic	data	 It does n't do much with its two leading actors , with whom it does n't have much chemistry , but the movie is still a pleasure to watch .	4
synthetic	data	 But it makes up for it in passion , courage and talent .	3
synthetic	data	 An impressive piece of work .	4
synthetic	data	 Does n't have an especially great script , but it has a surprisingly fine cast and a good direction .	3
synthetic	data	 A subtle , passionate study of the roots of darkness and its effectiveness on the human spirit .	3
synthetic	data	 Not a great film , not a bad one , but not even a bad movie .	1

synthetic	data	 Much of what you see is not all that surprising , given the topic .	2
synthetic	data	 A thoroughly enjoyable and frankly exciting film , not to mention very moving .	4
synthetic	data	 A surprisingly good , if not entirely original , psychological thriller .	3
synthetic	data	 At any rate , it is a fun , offbeat little movie .	4
synthetic	data	 The soundtrack is fun and ominous , and the editing is spot on .	3
synthetic	data	 As a psychological thriller , it 's far more accessible than its predecessors .	3
synthetic	data	 A pleasing collection of comedic observations , and a few laughs here and there ... can easily offset the film 's many off-putting moments .	2
synthetic	data	 Would you rather look at a photograph of a dead shark , or a dead boy ?	2
synthetic	data	 The film is made up of droll , half-baked , genre-bending comedy bits , and it is a little more watchable than most of the previous entries in the series .	2
synthetic	data	 The Movie is a big, sprawling popcorn flick ; it is just a little bit unfocused and a little bit unfocused .	1
synthetic	data	 The movie is so slow that it feels like watching an old bad video .	1
synthetic	data	 I tried to relax and enjoy the movie , but I was too busy trying to beat the clock .	1
synthetic	data	 The movie itself fails to connect with audiences , with the people put through its series of twists .	0
synthetic	data	 -LRB- The -RRB- star , who is a perfectly capable actor , is stiflingly shy .	1
synthetic	data	 It would have been better if the movie were n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't .	2
synthetic	data	 I would be willing to give it two or three more chances , but it will most likely never happen .	1
synthetic	data	 The movie plays like an elaborate , contrived piece of flatulence , which is about as convincing as an opening scene from a low-budget , low-budget animated comedy .	0
synthetic	data	 Where the first movie was a sweet , bittersweet , and mostly well-acted comedy , this one is a dreck of bad timing , uninspired dialogue , and inattention to detail .	0
synthetic	data	 An often unbearable and tiresome exercise in film noir absurdity .	1
synthetic	data	 ... a clumsy , sleazy piece of sloppy filmmaking that ultimately comes off as little more than a cheap stunt version of an action film .	0
synthetic	data	 A film that tries to be all things to all people without stepping out of its own narrow and self-centered world .	1
synthetic	data	 It just comes off as a bunch of people talking over each other , and that is just my sort of movie .	1
synthetic	data	 What a truly awful waste of a fantastic talent .	0
synthetic	data	 The film is so amateurish at times that I am almost inclined to believe the director is a particularly inept actor .	1
synthetic	data	 I found myself hankering to hear the voice of the monster , who never came to life , or the dark lord , who never died .	0
synthetic	data	 I finished the film with an empty stomach , wishing for a slice of pizza .	1
synthetic	data	 A rather unimpressive blend of stylish direction and a pretty pathetic script .	1
synthetic	data	 A movie that demands to be seen to be believed .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's not just a movie , it is a movement .	4
synthetic	data	 The movie has a surprising poignancy .	4
synthetic	data	 It does n't always hit home .	1
synthetic	data	 It 's worth a try , but stay with it ... and you 'll see why it 's a big deal , at least to those in this movie .	3
synthetic	data	 -- and it is worth a try -- but it 's not for everyone .	2
synthetic	data	 The only problem ?	1
synthetic	data	 is that it 's just too darned good .	3
synthetic	data	 A film so sophisticated and nuanced it gives you the feeling you 've known the characters all along .	3
synthetic	data	 This low-key , honest , funny and fascinating film is a testament to the timelessness and beauty of friendship .	3
synthetic	data	 A sweet , surreal sci-fi epic where the characters become familiar , and the world becomes something to be seen .	4
synthetic	data	 A surprisingly straightforward drama that manages to tickle your funny bone and hold your attention .	3
synthetic	data	 Even if it 's not as slickly done as some of the more well-known documentaries , this film is a very warm and sympathetic portrait of a man who gave up a comfortable , high-powered life to dedicate himself full-time to helping others .	3
synthetic	data	 ... a cinematic celebration of the wonderful , mysterious life of the modern tourist .	4
synthetic	data	 It 's a film about small victories . 	3
synthetic	data	 It 's about a man and a woman and the pleasures of sharing and appreciating one another .	4
synthetic	data	 ... a warm and encouraging piece of work that gives the stage a welcome counterpoint to the bitter , sensationalistic , and often cruel realness to the current business climate .	3
synthetic	data	 Exceptional performances from all the characters , along with solid performances by director Peter Bogdanovich and co-writer Peter Ackerman and star Joaquin Phoenix , provide a welcome diversion from the usual fare in this summer 's summer season .	3
synthetic	data	 I 've been a fan of his work since the first installment of The Evil Dead in the early '80s .	2
synthetic	data	 Instead of being a fable of an ancient tradition , the movie is a story of a young woman 's journey to find herself and the new world she seeks .	4
synthetic	data	 The film , like many of Kubrick 's , is a master class in the art of subtlety .	3
synthetic	data	 -LRB- has a good sense of humor , though his attempts to come up with creative new ways of testing the audience 's tolerance are usually as crude as the jokes .	1
synthetic	data	 A fascinating exploration of two families , one Chinese and one French , that collide in a violent and tumultuous marriage .	2

synthetic	data	 I enjoyed this movie , more than I did the last one , and I hope I have a chance to see it again .	3
synthetic	data	 A lot of what we see is actually staged , but it 's fun to watch it .	3
synthetic	data	 All in all , well-directed and -CGI -committed , but curiously lacking in character , plot and humor .	1
synthetic	data	 It is a thoroughly enjoyable film , a mixture of science fiction , romance , horror , romance-comedy and mystery .	3
synthetic	data	 It is sad , poignant and funny , and not without its real historical anecdotes .	3
synthetic	data	 An utter bore .	0
synthetic	data	 We need to move on and get back to romantic comedies .	2
synthetic	data	 A decent action thriller with some good and some not so good moments , but ultimately feels very forced and low-budget .	2

synthetic	data	 Absolutely appalling in its dullness .	0
synthetic	data	 The way it `s written , it `s basically a movie , and you could just watch it for a couple of hours . '	1

synthetic	data	 The `` Mr. Mom " video is , by far , the clearest and most powerful example yet of the power of the video to spread a message and change people hearts .	3
synthetic	data	 This movie is so bad that you have to force yourself to keep watching it .	0
synthetic	data	 It 's like watching a '' Good Times '' rip off a good one ... or a bad '' Good Times '' rip off a good one . ''	0
synthetic	data	 There was much more substance to `` Battleminds '' than the sum of its parts .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's chock-full of cheesy dialogue , dumb action sequences , and a lack of a clear purpose .	1

synthetic	data	 The movie 's plot is as ridiculous as the characters , while its cast of characters is almost as unmemorable as its title character .	0

synthetic	data	 But it is also a violent , smothering , and more than a little sadistic one .	1
synthetic	data	 At least it was until very late in the movie .	1
synthetic	data	 It is a film that at times is just too dark to fully enjoy .	1
synthetic	data	 The last chapter of one of the most idiosyncratic and creative cinema ever made .	4

synthetic	data	 It 's a compelling story and a captivating character study .	3
synthetic	data	 As an impassioned and impassioned film , it has a real heart of gold .	4
synthetic	data	 ... its ability to provoke and entertain is second to none .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's more than just a movie , it 's a life .	4
synthetic	data	 The actors and the script are so good , so believable , so human , that it 's a huge treat for the audience to feel connected to the characters and to feel immersed in the movie .	4
synthetic	data	 The film is a marvel of visual production , and one that is rarely seen on this scale .	3
synthetic	data	 But it could be a lot better ... as an hour-and-a-half feature , it fails .	1

synthetic	data	 It 's like a combination of The Thing , The Incredible Hulk and The Terminator .	1
synthetic	data	 One of those rare movies that just makes you want to go home and watch it again .	3
synthetic	data	 When it starts to get dark and the story goes into some dark territory , it never lets up .	2
synthetic	data	 The characters have a believable sense of selfhood and the script draws you in and crams you into the story .	3
synthetic	data	 The movie 's most startling revelation is that it 's not so much an action flick as it is a film about the nature of love .	3
synthetic	data	 If you 're looking for a cool sounding , action-packed adult-swim-with-a-big-monster flick , you 'll find it here .	3
synthetic	data	 Of course , it is heavy-handed and crude and , sadly , very stupid .	1
synthetic	data	 The best thing it has going for it , however , is a high-quality story and terrific performances .	4
synthetic	data	 The film 's message is one that 's easy to accept : To be great in life , you 'll have to put your ego aside and do the right thing . '	4

synthetic	data	 The movie is a lot of fun .	3
synthetic	data	 Oh , and there are a lot of fish .	2
synthetic	data	 The story is funny in a mildly corny kind of way .	3

synthetic	data	 It 's only fair to give this film a B .	1
synthetic	data	 Nothing sticks .	1
synthetic	data	 It 's hard to think of a filmmaker who could be more out of touch with the world of the 1970s and '80s , where the most outrageous of movies -- or the most meaningful of stories , for that matter -- were about the only thing that mattered .	2

synthetic	data	 What 's most remarkable about `` Jackie Chan 's '' movies is that they never feel tired or unfocused .	3
synthetic	data	 A solid but not inspiring movie .	3
synthetic	data	 -- and yet it feels like it 's skipping past places in the middle .	1
synthetic	data	 As satisfying as it is , `` Loose Change '' is n't a particularly impressive movie .	2
synthetic	data	 Even better , it 's a movie .	2

synthetic	data	 The movie starts out with a lot of promise , but then falls to pieces in its final act .	1
synthetic	data	 `` Iron-Man '' was not a great movie , but it had its moments .	1
synthetic	data	 In this case , it 's a bad decision , because the movie is so bad that it will probably leave you wondering why you paid for it .	2

synthetic	data	 A solid , compelling affair , and one that is at once smart and funny .	3
synthetic	data	 A little too self-consciously grand , and not enough of an homage to help it stand out .	1
synthetic	data	 It 's a shame that the screenplay was written by someone who apparently is not a fan of The West Wing , but at least it has the decency to give it a second look .	2
synthetic	data	 This one has a lot to offer , but it 's a little too long to be a good time .	1
synthetic	data	 This was an interesting experiment that did n't develop fully until the end , when a creative breakthrough is possible only with a film that has been in production for a year and a half .	4
synthetic	data	 As a sequel , the film is a big disappointment , but it 's a good time to be alive .	4

synthetic	data	 It has a big heart and it does n't judge , either .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's well-made and deeply moving , but also realistically realistic ... and that makes it a worthy addition to the bicentennial collection .	4
synthetic	data	 It is a movie that makes you see the world with fresh eyes and make connections with others that you might have missed before .	4
synthetic	data	 As an exercise in well-made urban fantasy , it keeps you guessing that the magic is real .	3
synthetic	data	 The film is actually a lot funnier than it is scary , which is a plus .	3
synthetic	data	 One of the most fun movies to come out of the Sundance Film Festival in recent memory .	4
synthetic	data	 '' Sweet Home Alabama '' is a quirky , sweet romantic comedy with a gentle , sweet romance in the heart .	3
synthetic	data	 `` I 'm Dreaming of Denmark '' is far from a perfect film , but it 's a welcome addition to the genre .	2
synthetic	data	 It 's a fun little movie that deserves a bigger screen .	2
synthetic	data	 The movie 's unforced pacing and strong performances , especially its leading lady , Charley Pollard , do n't hurt either .	3
synthetic	data	 The film has its share of laughs , but it also has some serious issues .	3

synthetic	data	 A poor attempt to be an interesting movie and a very disappointing one .	0
synthetic	data	 A movie that is n't quite good enough .	1
synthetic	data	 Too much of the film is spent on familiar scenes of the kind that have made The Graduate so popular for the last 30 years .	2
synthetic	data	 It 's a movie that is so loaded with platitudes that it makes the actual story feel like a blip on the calendar .	0
synthetic	data	The film is also rinky-dink , with one of the strongest performances of the year from Eddie Redmayne as the pugnacious British writer Alan Partridge .	1
synthetic	data	 Dressed in a sweet , muted color palette , the movie 's characters are convincing and instantly likable ... The magic occurs when the cast and crew develop a profound rapport , as the movie fades to black .	4

synthetic	data	 The plot is simple , but it works .	2
synthetic	data	 The screenplay , by Adam Shankman and John Francis Daley , is as engaging as a good New England summer .	4

synthetic	data	 The movie is so good -LRB- that -RRB- the director and cast have been known to walk for three days straight without stopping -LRB- with a case of the giggles -RRB- to ensure that the audience feels as if the hairs on the back of their necks were standing up .	2

synthetic	data	 ... the real issue is whether the average moviegoer is up to the task of sitting through four hours of mindless action and dumb jokes . '	1
synthetic	data	 The biggest problem with the movie is the constant and implausible soap opera that ensues .	1

synthetic	data	The cast also has a unique knack for bringing to life the nuanced characters that emerge from an uncertain situation .	3
synthetic	data	 An interesting film that takes a fresh look at the entire documentary industry and attempts to draw some lessons from its fascinating past .	2
synthetic	data	 All the while , the cast remains n't dead-on in their performance .	3

synthetic	data	 A quietly moving story about a girl who has the courage to live .	3

synthetic	data	 ... you 'd have to be dumber than a sack of hammers to even notice the movie is only about 90 minutes .	1

synthetic	data	 What 's most special about This Is Spinal Tap , however , is its people ... and the human drama that 's at the heart of its story . '	4
synthetic	data	 ... the film is at its best when it 's trying something new , when it 's not afraid of its audience being rude , or of telling really stupid jokes , or of showing the audience just how stupid and inane human nature really is . '	3

synthetic	data	 Not only does the romantic comedy seem out of place in this holiday season , it also feels like a contrivance .	1
synthetic	data	 The filmmakers leave so much on the table -- mostly too cleverly , in my view -- that it becomes difficult to care about any of the characters , including the lead .	1
synthetic	data	 The movie is so self-consciously self-referential that it 's hard to care even about the characters .	0
synthetic	data	 The movie is just so badly made that I would have expected the studio to walk away from the project with a bill for at least $300,000 .	0
synthetic	data	 It 's a sloppy piece of filmmaking that works better as a B-movie .	0
synthetic	data	 ... more or less ignores the fact that the film is a commercial disaster -- not because of the lack of a plot , nor because of its generic characters or its tired , contrived structure .	1

synthetic	data	 The movie has a story , which it does effectively , but it begins to fall apart around the middle , and it does n't do a great job of keeping the audience on its toes .	1
synthetic	data	 The only problem I have with Mr. Brel 's movie is the way it mugs at both its own story and the audience 's .	0
synthetic	data	 The best thing about The Ice Storm is that it is not that bad .	4

synthetic	data	 As it begins to pull back , it reveals itself to be one of the most interesting and surprising female-centered movies of the year .	4
synthetic	data	 The film has some quirky moments , but there are also those that just seem contrived : a movie where the main character and his wife are two women with one car , and where the women 's clothes have a habit of getting stuck in the window frame .	2
synthetic	data	 At its best , the movie builds to something more than a simple story line .	2
synthetic	data	 The film has all the narrative arc of a good and unmemorable bedtime tale and none of the heart .	1
synthetic	data	 A little too formulaic for its own good .	0
synthetic	data	 Every now and then a movie comes along that makes you consider that maybe , just maybe , you need to go see it more than once .	1
synthetic	data	 The movie 's over-used plot devices and superficialities are so repetitive that I found myself scratching my head more than once .	1
synthetic	data	 It 's the same old schmaltz that has been done so many times before .	1
synthetic	data	 Raimi 's obsession with action and his sense of humor aside , he has not a hint of subtlety or poetry in his movies .	0
synthetic	data	 That 's not to say that there is no humor in ` The Wicker Man ' .	1
synthetic	data	 It just never springs to life .	1
synthetic	data	 A bad comedy at best .	1
synthetic	data	 -LRB- '' The Shindler 's List , '' -RRB- '' gets it right ' , even if director Peter Bogdanovich and co-writers Gary Goldman and Paul Verhoeven are a little too scared to show it . '	2
synthetic	data	 -LRB- '' The Social Network '' -RRB- has a good message about the power of public service but its over-the-top , irreverent tone just makes it an uneven movie .	0

synthetic	data	 Maybe it is , but it is not .	2
synthetic	data	 It could have been much funnier .	2
synthetic	data	 The film 's humor , in particular the scene where the titular man does his best to win the heart of his very young girlfriend , is quite entertaining .	4

synthetic	data	 A funny , whimsical film that delves into the psychology of men who are in love , and the lengths in which they go to conceal their love .	3
synthetic	data	 ... a fairly good , funny film that 's a little too sentimental and too afraid to be too sexy .	1
synthetic	data	 A fascinating , emotional journey from quiet desperation to unexpected laughter .	3
synthetic	data	 The story ... has its moments of intense insight , and what makes it special is that it 's true .	3
synthetic	data	 The film is based on two true stories , a real-life episode and a famous novel by a well-known French author .	3

synthetic	data	 The first year of college is a time to look at yourself and your future .	3
synthetic	data	 A smart and hilarious film , but not a particularly memorable one .	2
synthetic	data	In fact, a lot of her stories - about the misery of poverty , the joy of laughter , the anger of oppression - are so raw that they could have come straight out of One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest .	2

synthetic	data	 This really is as raw and nasty as it sounds .	2
synthetic	data	 A sweet , gentle , and touching film .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's the most humane and heartfelt movie I 've seen in a long while .	4
synthetic	data	 The story is not always clear , but there is no doubt in my mind that this documentary is the best documentary of the year .	3
synthetic	data	 A film that has the power to turn public opinion against the American government , nuke the Pentagon and cause a national panic .	3
synthetic	data	 One of the most important films on the war on terror since Fahrenheit 9/11 .	3
synthetic	data	 The most satisfying and enjoyable indie movie of the year .	4
synthetic	data	 It is beautifully shot and shot with an unerring calmness that makes you feel as if you are watching something grand and sublimely beautiful .	3
synthetic	data	 Just another good indie movie .	3
synthetic	data	 Even good things need to be repeated .	2
synthetic	data	 It 's not the most original concept , or anything -- , really , its a pretty standard gangster movie -- , but this is inoffensive cinema from start to finish .	3
synthetic	data	 The movie 's a good time .	4
synthetic	data	 The plot is about as conventional as a T-shirt can get , and director Peter Jackson is a master in the art of using cliches and cliché .	2
synthetic	data	 An intriguing , if somewhat derivative , take on the spy thriller , some of the better of these movies have been released in the last six years .	3
synthetic	data	 The A-Team director Gerard McMurray , a veteran of the genre , is at his best here -- and his visual flair and his understanding of the character 's emotional arc is always on point .	4
synthetic	data	 The movie has all the slick tricks of marketing , but none of the strategy , which might cost any of the filmmakers their jobs .	2
synthetic	data	 A film that plays like a television dramatization of a true story .	3
synthetic	data	 An hour of fun with a lot of dramatic potential .	4
synthetic	data	 Viva la revolución !	3
synthetic	data	 By the time the movie ends , the lovers are wracked with guilt , the audience with sympathy , and even the film 's young heroine is left wondering how she could ever have let it happen .	2
synthetic	data	 Actually , the movie is nothing like that .	0
synthetic	data	 Stirs and hums with a quiet intensity like a well-bred , well-fed dog , and it has a soft spot in its heart for its audience .	3
synthetic	data	 The script , directed by Mark Romanek and Oscar nominee Tom Shadyac , is rich with a lush and evocative , almost poetic , pastel palette of colors .	4
synthetic	data	 It even beats the jaded rhythms and brassy rhythms of the music industry .	3
synthetic	data	 An engrossing and moving mystery , full of aplomb and wonder .	4
synthetic	data	 Just as it makes you feel as though you are a part of the story , the latest film by director Catherine Breillat , Re-Animator , pulls you into it .	3
synthetic	data	 A smart and sophisticated documentary in the truest sense of the word .	3
synthetic	data	 But it 's also a film that is very hard to relate to .	1
synthetic	data	 The movie is well-acted , but even in its best scenes , there is the slightest hint of cliche .	1
synthetic	data	 It is a film that is mostly dutiful , though it gives admirable consideration to the reasons why one is forced to do what you do .	2
synthetic	data	 It is a breezy , easygoing comedy with a movie-star in it .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's worth seeing .	3
synthetic	data	 ... a dull , soggy , hollow exercise in the art of the unlikable villain .	1
synthetic	data	 This is one of those films that goes out of its way to remind us that , as far as movies are concerned , it 's always 's about the children .	2
synthetic	data	 The script and the performances are just too bad to be of any interest .	0
synthetic	data	 There 's often a sense that more is being lost than is actually put on screen .	1
synthetic	data	 It 's all too easy to find yourself rooting for the bad guy to succeed and to have his schemes foiled , whether or not his plans actually work .	1
synthetic	data	 The film is stuffed with thematic jeremiads about social mores and gender , but as is often the case when the filmmakers are trying to make sweeping statements about the human condition , they run into roadblocks .	2
synthetic	data	 There 's no denying the talent of the writers and artists involved , but there are enough niggling plot holes and confusing character squanderers that they drag the story down .	0
synthetic	data	 The problem , I think , is that the film is doomed to linger in our collective memory like a bad ex-lover .	0
synthetic	data	 The film is a tedious pile of schmaltz that feels forced , contrived and barely coherent .	1
synthetic	data	 After three features I have to say I 'm sick of this sort of thing .	1
synthetic	data	 I 'd honestly give anything for that film to be a little more adventurous .	2
synthetic	data	 A remarkably narrow piece of work that is basically a 90-minute television episode thrown together into a movie .	1
synthetic	data	 Just a trifle more inventive than most of the rest of the film .	2
synthetic	data	 A movie that spends too much time on the silliest things in the world , and too little time on telling us what it 's about .	1
synthetic	data	 The film is too easily formulaic .	1
synthetic	data	 Just as Michael Jackson 's '' Thriller '' is still one of the most popular songs in history , ' The Hangover ' is still going strong .	2
synthetic	data	 The only thing that 's missing is a little good old-fashioned Hollywood magic .	1
synthetic	data	 The music does n't do much for this movie , and the actors do n't perform much of anything .	1
synthetic	data	 It is a film that is dull , predictable and , worst of all , repetitious .	0
synthetic	data	 It 's a movie that will play on multiple video systems at once and eventually wears out its welcome with those who have not already made arrangements to go to see it .	0
synthetic	data	 It 's a movie that just does n't have enough jokes to make it funny .	0
synthetic	data	 In all my years of watching this movie , I 've never seen a film with such a thin script and so many characters , and it 's all too easy to lose track of who is who .	1
synthetic	data	 It 's just a bunch of blokes in a black car talking about nothing in particular .	0
synthetic	data	 It 's not a bad movie , just the kind of pretentious little movie you 'd expect from an animator from the '70s .	2
synthetic	data	 The reason the film 's an A- is because of the chemistry between the lead characters .	2
synthetic	data	 Because it has a little something for everyone .	3
synthetic	data	 That 's a good thing when you have a movie that is as well-written and very well-acted as the first � but it 's hard to take advantage of that good taste when the action is so slapdash , the dialogue is so cliched and the performances are so stiff .	1
synthetic	data	 The movie is a mess .	0
synthetic	data	 It 's a mess because it is a mess , and that 's what makes it a memorable one .	2
synthetic	data	 -RRB- If you can get past the tediousness of some of the plot points , you have a very good film on your hands .	3

synthetic	data	 I have no idea what all the fuss is about , but it is well worth the price of admission .	4
synthetic	data	 The film is unpretentious , smart , funny and well-acted , with funny and smart performances .	4
synthetic	data	 It is exactly what it is : a dark comedy .	4
synthetic	data	 A picture of the future that will appeal to both the tech savvy and the tech-fluent .	4
synthetic	data	 -LRB- A quick and breezy , relaxed thriller that may not be as sophisticated as it sounds . '	3
synthetic	data	 Perturbators , on the other hand , are more than they seem .	2
synthetic	data	 It 's not a perfect film , and it 's not without its flaws . '	1
synthetic	data	 But it is a movie worth watching and admiring .	3
synthetic	data	 A wild , wild ride . '	3
synthetic	data	 The cast , without a doubt , are some of the best one can find in a film about the 1960s .	3
synthetic	data	 A subtle , sophisticated film that makes us see ourselves in each other 's shoes . '	3
synthetic	data	 Whether you liked it or not , the movie is not only a work of art but also a work of life-affirming homage . '	3
synthetic	data	 A dark and brooding drama that also encourages us all to stop foisting our own problems on the next person we 've ever met and to get serious . '	4
synthetic	data	 A beautiful , bittersweet piece of filmmaking that does n't flinch from the harsh realities of a class-struck Korean youth .	3
synthetic	data	 Those of us who have experienced the horrors of the Korean War for ourselves must admit that ` War ' is not only a riveting movie but a tender , eloquent testament to human frailty and courage .	4
synthetic	data	 Just as ' Platoon ' sparked a movie-going generation , ` A Few Good Men ' is giving a new generation of military wives opportunities that will last a lifetime . '	3
synthetic	data	 It 's fun , it 's funny , it 's touching and it has a story that is as true-to-life as it is heartfelt . '	4
synthetic	data	 For much of the film , the girls are as fragile as their father , and their relationship has the texture of a battered woman who is trying to remain strong amid the chaos of her life .	3
synthetic	data	 The filmmakers ... have ... produced a unique and compelling film that carries the cast and the story , even when the camera is absent .	4
synthetic	data	 The film is a very personal collection of moments .	4
synthetic	data	 The story is one of loneliness , and it makes you feel like there is no way that you could ever ever win .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's about as good as a pack of wild dogs , but it is n't as bad as a pack of jackals .	1
synthetic	data	 It 's one of those rare films that is not only more satisfying than its subject , but it is also infinitely funnier .	3
synthetic	data	 Bridget Jones should be a lot more enjoyable than it is .	2
synthetic	data	 It helps , of course , that it is directed by Adam Sandler .	4
synthetic	data	 The film is also very funny and made me think a lot about how we as humans relate to one another .	3
synthetic	data	 An extraordinary feat of filmmaking .	4
synthetic	data	 Where the film seems a bit dry and technical , and the screenplay is about as funny as a badly made soap opera , the characters are actually funny .	4
synthetic	data	 The most remarkable thing about The Artist is the way it breaks down traditional notions of good and evil -- and what they mean .	3
synthetic	data	 ... the filmmakers are quite right to point out that this book is both a classic satire and a parable for our own times .	3
synthetic	data	 The only problem is that it ` does n't have the same ring to it as it did 90 years ago . '	0
synthetic	data	 This stupefyingly depressing film ... gets worse and worse before it suddenly explodes into a hideous firestorm of gore .	2
synthetic	data	 By that measure , it is a triumph .	3
synthetic	data	 The only thing more depressing than the over-the-top behavior of these people is the fact that they seem to have no trouble getting what they want .	0
synthetic	data	 Although the film seems to take a different tack from the source material , it has a wonderfully melodramatic quality .	3
synthetic	data	 The performances are great , the story is fascinating , and the movie is well acted .	3
synthetic	data	 The movie itself is as confusing as it is intriguing .	3
synthetic	data	 It 'll take you by surprise .	2
synthetic	data	 Despite its flaws , it is a well-made , challenging film .	4
synthetic	data	 It is certainly a movie worth seeing .	4
synthetic	data	 The story it tells is very much a movie , in that it is a film about a man in love with another man .	3
synthetic	data	 ... a film of genuine emotion and human drama .	3
synthetic	data	 The film is all about the emotions , of course , but it is also quite a bit more than that .	1
synthetic	data	 A good , though small , splash of romantic comedy in a genre whose defining trait is its lack of ambition .	3
synthetic	data	 The cast is terrific -- and it 's fun from start to finish .	4

synthetic	data	 The film , like its title character , is a marvel of imagination .	4
synthetic	data	 It 's that terrific .	4
synthetic	data	 A film that keeps you guessing with its twists and turns : twists that are never quite revealed , but which are so frequently encountered in the course of the film that it becomes difficult to keep track of where the action ends and the story begins .	3
synthetic	data	 The movie is neither too long nor too short , but it has enough of an underlying groove to keep you interested .	3
synthetic	data	 As its title suggests , High Crimes serves up a feast of bad behavior .	3

synthetic	data	 What surprises people about The Case Against Kevin Spacey is its lack of overt political point -- a film that has nothing to do with the real-life Kevin Spacey , anyway .	1
synthetic	data	 The best thing about this film is that it 's a little goofy , a little silly , a little unfocused , but it still stays on your mind .	4
synthetic	data	 ... an honest , unblinking depiction of the struggles of a woman on the brink of mental breakdown facing a life in which she deals with choices and judgments that would be unthinkable to most of us .	3

synthetic	data	 The film could have used a fresh , provocative angle , and , maybe , a little more humor .	2
synthetic	data	 For all its star power , there 's something about the movie that feels a bit flat .	1
synthetic	data	 There 's a fine line between entertaining and amusing , and in `` The Karate Kid '' , the actors just crossed the line .	2
synthetic	data	 The film is entertaining enough to keep you engaged , but it never really catches fire .	2

synthetic	data	 So much of the film is spent in a sequence of shots that are so monotonous , you 'll want to close your eyes and throw up .	2
synthetic	data	 The script is so stilted , and so often too self-consciously self-congratulatory that it 's hard to care about the characters .	1
synthetic	data	 The picture has a lot of potential , but it 's sadly too ploddingly muddled to deliver much in the way of pleasure .	1
synthetic	data	 With the exception of the scene where Liza Minnelli 's character crawls out of the bathtub , the story contains no surprises or dramatic tension .	1
synthetic	data	 Yet as I watched the film , I thought the production design and costume design were just as well-conceived as the film 's screenplay .	2
synthetic	data	 The film 's message of the need for a more open approach to art and creativity is a good one , and it does n't go far enough .	1
synthetic	data	 It will likely be a while before anyone has seen it again , but it 's worth a look if only for the performance of L.J. -- a quiet , beautiful presence .	3
synthetic	data	 Even though it has a happy ending , the movie is ultimately self-defeating .	1
synthetic	data	 The film 's sheer badness is exhilarating .	1
synthetic	data	 This is an exhausting movie to sit through , and that is why it earns only 3 thumbs down .	0

synthetic	data	 A movie that shows that a good story doesn 't have to be about a single character ; even the most clichéd story can be engrossing and beautiful .	4
synthetic	data	 The whole thing is a portrait of a woman who is a master of the French language and a living museum of her culture .	3
synthetic	data	 The only thing I 'd change is the ending .	1

synthetic	data	 A quietly compelling fable about a man who seems unable to connect with others and who eventually takes a fatal fall into darkness .	2
synthetic	data	 Though the film is slow to get moving , there are a couple of fascinating moments , and the material is truly gripping .	3
synthetic	data	 There are definite highlights -- such as the director 's inventive use of flashbacks -- but the film ultimately fails to fully rise above the level of a passing fable .	1

synthetic	data	 Although the characters are colorful and colorful personalities are on display , the plot is surprisingly thin .	1
synthetic	data	 The plotline falls into an abyss of cliched clichés .	0
synthetic	data	 Freundlich 's direction is too mechanical , while the plot is too contrived .	1

synthetic	data	 It 's all too easy for this movie to veer into the territory of soap opera or even a horror movie .	0

synthetic	data	 The result is a movie that feels like a cross between a movie about a madcap child-'s Christmas party and a movie about a movie .	1

synthetic	data	 The film is a slow burn , and the filmmakers know it .	1
synthetic	data	 The film is just too good to pass up .	4

synthetic	data	 The film not only succeeds as a compelling film , it has a satisfying emotional ending that is like having a meal with one of those old ladies who will make you feel like a grownup for a while .	3
synthetic	data	 A bright , quirky and surprisingly affecting comedy about two brothers , one of whom has just moved in with them and the other whose family he has forswore .	3
synthetic	data	 The movie is so much more than the sum of its parts .	4
synthetic	data	 The film is a fun ride , funnier than a goat on a leash , more clever and more sophisticated than a pop group , and more interesting than an episode of Jerry Springer .	3
synthetic	data	 A masterfully made film that will leave you feeling refreshed , amused , and a little frightened .	4
synthetic	data	 This film is as entertaining as it is sad but never quite suffocating .	4
synthetic	data	 The film is also gorgeous and breathtaking .	3
synthetic	data	 One of those films that will make you love cinema once it is out of your system , and I love cinema enough to think that will be the case .	4
synthetic	data	 It 's just one of those rare gems that will never be seen on the big screen again .	2
synthetic	data	 It focuses on the lives of ordinary people , not the grand events of the world 's great wars , and it does so from a perspective that is deeply humanistic , even if it is often a little hard to take .	3
synthetic	data	 There is wonderful pathos in the picture and an incisive sense of how the events are part of the human condition .	3
synthetic	data	 It truly is a movie about something , and it 's really good at what it does .	3
synthetic	data	 The message of the movie is that people can change . '	3
synthetic	data	 Director Martin Campbell and co-writer John Erick Dowdle have created an interesting blend of psychological realism and melodrama to make a powerful drama .	3
synthetic	data	Of course, there are great films to be had even in this bleak age .	3
synthetic	data	 A dazzling , deeply satisfying film .	3
synthetic	data	 If only the director would stop asking more of the audience and just get down to the business of telling a fun , sprightly tale .	4
synthetic	data	 A charming and funny story .	4
synthetic	data	 It 's rich , it 's vibrant , it has more energy , and , most important of all , it knows it is your story .	4
synthetic	data	 The big question , which you will never be able to answer , is whether it really is possible to escape the shadow of the past .	1
synthetic	data	 A funny , thoughtful , and heartwarming documentary that lives up to its title .	4
synthetic	data	 Lotharios and gutter punks should feel right at home on this wild and crazy , but well-meaning , Hollywood road .	4
synthetic	data	 He may not have gotten the highest numbers of votes ever , but I 'm doubtful that a more deserving candidate came .	2
synthetic	data	 There is nothing truly wrong with the movie , but the problem lies with an audience that does n't give a damn .	2
synthetic	data	 There were a lot of good performances in this film , and these are not necessarily the best performances .	3
synthetic	data	 The fact that it is mostly a collection of clips of various '' terrible '' people trying to make ends meet is not a good thing , but it 's trifling compared to the real thing .	2
synthetic	data	 This is a movie that opens with a chilling , dread-laden music score , segues smoothly from one mood to the other without ever straying imperceptibly into dreary exposition , and ends with a bang .	4
synthetic	data	 A rich comic treatment of a man who lacks even a shred of self-awareness .	3
synthetic	data	 It is almost a shame that a film of this quality should be produced by an established studio , because the actors and the script are impeccable .	4
synthetic	data	 An old-fashioned , strong , entertaining thriller .	4
synthetic	data	 It 's a comedy about a misfit left to his own devices in a time of upheaval .	3

synthetic	data	 An unflinching look at a group of young people trying to make their way through a difficult world and survive .	3
synthetic	data	 What makes _The Hours _ special is that its movie-making is not merely competent but simply beautiful ... -LRB- There is no mistaking the talent of Daniel Day-Lewis in the film .	4
synthetic	data	 This is a movie where the plot never gets dull .	2
synthetic	data	 The star power of all the producers adds to this movie 's appeal . '	3
synthetic	data	 The movie has a certain magical quality about it . '	3
synthetic	data	 The film is so gripping that it almost makes me want to go to sleep . '	3
synthetic	data	 The whole ordeal demands that you go home and remind yourself that the last thing the people of this village need is another tragedy of the commons . '	2
synthetic	data	 It 's a rare feature film that does n't try to be as big as life ... but also as small as life . '	2
synthetic	data	 A movie that 's so authentically American that it 's worth watching . '	2
synthetic	data	 A film that tells a smart story of the power of love and forgiveness and sticks with it through a lot of tumult and pressure . '	3
synthetic	data	 The beauty of this film lies in its subtlety . '	4
synthetic	data	 Director Gary Trousdale 's direction is fluid , and the film is at times an unpredictable delight . '	3
synthetic	data	 A film that portrays the devastation of war and how it changes the inhabitants of war-torn countries , but also the joy of life in a small neighborhood of humble and kind people . '	3
synthetic	data	 The story of Grace is a great one , and it is told with clarity and insight enough to nourish all of us .	4
synthetic	data	The characters are wackier than I'd thought .	3
synthetic	data	 The film 's political undercurrents are subtle , and the film does n't exploit them .	4
synthetic	data	 As a documentary , though , this slim , tidy hour isn 't as engaging as some of the stuff that 's been put on film .	1
synthetic	data	 The characters are flawed and , at times , self-indulgent , but they are quirky , compelling and human .	3
synthetic	data	 The action is almost always good , even when it does n't match the animation , and the performances are remarkably consistent .	3
synthetic	data	 Director Michael Apted , who was the first to use the term ' ` musical comedy ' in his breakthrough movie Annie Hall , made an astoundingly good sequel .	3
synthetic	data	 Do n't miss the ending , when the characters are reminded that they are on the brink of a great discovery .	3
synthetic	data	 A charming but oddly pathetic coming-of-age tale .	1
synthetic	data	 The plot is uneventful , but the characters make up for it with remarkable warmth , intelligence and intelligence itself .	3
synthetic	data	 The story is surprisingly light and the acting is surprisingly smooth .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's surprisingly enjoyable , especially if you are an avid music fan .	3
synthetic	data	 -LRB- The -RRB- production design is beautiful and the costumes and sets are quite detailed .	3
synthetic	data	 ... it 's a fast-moving comedy that sticks with you .	4
synthetic	data	 The performances are terrific , and the dialogue is funny and often wise .	3
synthetic	data	 I loved -LRB- This is Where I Leave You -RRB- , a documentary about the life of a New Jersey woman who went on to become a highly successful and well-liked Broadway actress .	3
synthetic	data	 The plot is a bit thin , and the characters are not very interesting , but the performances are heartwarming and the romance is sweet .	3
synthetic	data	 The special effects are really impressive , and the film has a slow burn that is funny and heartfelt .	3
synthetic	data	 The cast is solid , and the writing is witty .	4
synthetic	data	 The same actor gives it another shot , and brings this long-overdue tragedy back to life .	3
synthetic	data	 In the same way that the original film is a work of art , so is this one .	3
synthetic	data	 Mr. Schulman 's achievement is two-fold : he has given us a work that is faithful to the original film while also updating it for the TV age ; he gives us a film that is even-handed , smart and sympathetic .	3
synthetic	data	 Mr. Mancuso has dealt with the absurdity of this situation with a sense of humor , and the result is a genuinely funny , moving story .	4
synthetic	data	 While the movie may not be as cohesive as the original film , it 's still an entertaining , original , and genuinely moving one .	4
synthetic	data	 Silliness is a very welcome respite and the filmmakers wisely leave out the silly moments and take care to create characters that are more than cardboard cutouts .	2
synthetic	data	 The film is surprisingly touching , even if it is not as intelligent and edifying as it could have been .	4
synthetic	data	 You want to hug the actors ... and the mother .	3
synthetic	data	 The movie looks and sounds and feels like a real classic , even though its jokes are as dated as those of `` Full House '' and `` The Brady Bunch . ''	3
synthetic	data	 -LRB- A -RRB- really , really solid , fascinating , stylish and creepy thriller .	3
synthetic	data	 ... a well-crafted and thoroughly enjoyable movie .	4
synthetic	data	 As The Babadook evolves into one of our most sophisticated horror flicks , its own capacity for upsetting and shocking us becomes even more disturbing .	3
synthetic	data	 -LRB- It 's -RRB- a feature . '	3
synthetic	data	 The movie -- and these two stars -- seem to have come from a different universe .	2
synthetic	data	 They both give it an earnest charm that is both sweet and bitter .	3
synthetic	data	 -LRB- Just a little -RRB- too much .	1
synthetic	data	 Yet she does it all with such grace and wit that her work begins to resemble that of a native artist .	3
synthetic	data	 With a camera sweeping from shore to shore , from field to field , the New World is so well-crafted that it almost overshadows what is presented on screen .	2
synthetic	data	 It 's funny , moving and genuinely touching .	3
synthetic	data	 John Cusack makes for an amusing , if slightly monosyllabic , villain .	3
synthetic	data	 He 's not a bad guy , but you can n't really be much of a fan of human nature without a side dish of injustice .	1
synthetic	data	 It 's hard to be sanguine about moviegoers nowadays , but this one 's got a good shot of being one of the best of the year .	3
synthetic	data	 If you 've got the stomach for the action movie fare and the guts to embrace a dark , twisted tale , then Motorcycle Diaries may be just the ticket .	3
synthetic	data	 A sweet , funny , engrossing story with plenty of drama , heart and a great deal of laughs .	3
synthetic	data	 Hollywood is full of great movies , but this one stands out .	3
synthetic	data	 The movie is so entertaining you wonder whether E.T. would have been better off turning off the lights and going to bed .	3
synthetic	data	 -LRB- A -RRB- spooky , intriguing and fun movie .	3
synthetic	data	 What would be the point of making the movie if there 's nothing notable to see ?	1
synthetic	data	 After all , that 's what you 're supposed to do !	2
synthetic	data	 Aside from its mediocre direction , it 's just not that funny .	0
synthetic	data	 The only reason -LRB- The Incredibles -RRB- exists is that the filmmakers saw the success of the first film and felt that they could cash in for good publicity .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's not that bad , but it 's far from great .	1
synthetic	data	 It does n't have the guts of the first film , and it tries to take itself seriously at times .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's an entertaining movie , with a great cast and an intriguing storyline .	3
synthetic	data	 The film is so heavy handed in the last act that it becomes a chore .	2
synthetic	data	 It 's not so much the action that gives it a bad name as it is the way in which the action is handled .	0
synthetic	data	 A movie that makes you feel like you 've been through the wringer somehow , instead of as a human being `` in the world `` .	2
synthetic	data	 It 's a pity because it is a fun and often quite funny movie .	3
synthetic	data	 It is a movie about war .	3
synthetic	data	 `` The Big Lebowski '' is as much a work of art as Robert Altman 's `` The Player '' or as good as `` Dune '' .	4
synthetic	data	 I did n't enjoy Lebowski as much as I intended to , but I did n't mind it , either .	2
synthetic	data	 The trouble with a movie called `` The Big Lebowski '' is that what starts out as a laugh-out-loud comedy becomes all too close to `` Boogie Nights '' .	1
synthetic	data	 A very good thriller that is as witty as it is moving .	3
synthetic	data	 A fine young-adult film -LRB- made with a clear eye , a sensitive ear , and a warm heart .	3
synthetic	data	 ` The Man Who Wasn't There ' is one of those rare films that -- though its subject is nasty , crude and flat -- ' the characters are not . '	3
synthetic	data	 The film is a marvel of craft . ` '	3
synthetic	data	 -LRB- It also happens to be a delightful family outing . '	3
synthetic	data	 The documentary makes interesting and highly personal observations about the most dangerous people in our society , and the human side of their actions cannot be ignored .	3
synthetic	data	 A fascinating , visually stunning film .... it is a tour de force of a documentary . '	3
synthetic	data	 A fascinating film that will be a welcome addition to any filmmaking collection .	3
synthetic	data	 Is he the best thing since sliced bread ?	3
synthetic	data	 He moves fluidly between the present and the past , and the future and the past . '	2
synthetic	data	 One of the most disturbing and fascinating portrayals of madness I have ever seen . '	2
synthetic	data	 It 's a shame it didn 't have the same impact on us . '	1
synthetic	data	 Chabrol is a colorful young man who , in his own way , may have a future in film , rather than acting or writing . '	3
synthetic	data	 There 's a lot to admire in this film , especially the way it allows the characters to allow their own demons to define them . '	3
synthetic	data	 With so many romantic comedies and action movies doing the same thing -- filling the screen with brawny male action stars , bad guys who are defeated by the girls who are smart and strong -- this one is refreshing . '	3
synthetic	data	 It is a film so believable and moving that it 's hard not to feel sorry for the people being killed . '	2
synthetic	data	 The filmmakers ' determination to portray the events in this brutal war with the full awareness of their historical context is commendable . '	3
synthetic	data	 A fascinating film that manages to shake its audience to its core . '	4
synthetic	data	The film is as silly as its premise - a boy growing up in a world of superheroes , but also of supermodels and supertweets .	4
synthetic	data	 -LRB- But this is a funny film , and it makes sense , too .	4
synthetic	data	 -LRB- It is also , dammit , a very funny film ... -LRB- The characters are all more than believable .	4
synthetic	data	 -LRB- If you do n't like Spider-Man wot you see , you do n't have to see it .	1
synthetic	data	 -LRB- But it 's worth seeing .	4
synthetic	data	 It 's just that with these three films , I 'm not sure I 'm catching any more than I 've already .	0
synthetic	data	 -LRB- This guy is getting old .	1
synthetic	data	 -LRB- He 's a good actor , but he 's not a world-renowned filmmaker .	2
synthetic	data	 -LRB- No , he 's not .	1
synthetic	data	 -LRB- He 's just a guy who 's supposed to be doing something . '	2
synthetic	data	 He may be a nice enough guy , but he 's not very good at it ... '	1
synthetic	data	 The movie has a nice twist and a good story , but it is ultimately a bit of a mess .	2
synthetic	data	 A few of its more memorable moments are fleeting .	2
synthetic	data	 It has a few moments , sure , but there are so many more things you could say about this goofy drama .	0
synthetic	data	 Its runtime is much too long for what it has to offer .	1
synthetic	data	 But once you 've seen it , you 'll understand .	3
synthetic	data	 A movie that has all the pizazz of a wet T-shirt and the substance of a discarded condom .	2
synthetic	data	 It 's a weird , sloppy kind of fun that works because of the actors and the way they act together .	3
synthetic	data	 The film does us no favors by trying to pull whatever storyline we are supposed to buy off us , assuming the film starts with a bang .	1
synthetic	data	 -LRB- A -LRB- Bizzare , WTF -LRB- made-for-TV-movie . '	2
synthetic	data	 ... is far too familiar and not terribly original .	1
synthetic	data	 This film is so engrossing that one cannot help but think about the films one does not see at the cinema and feel guilt for missing them .	3
synthetic	data	 It would be nice to see a film about a man who runs away from home , who goes to the woods , and spends the nights drinking beer and trying to kill himself , a film about his struggle with the loss of his family , his need to be loved , and his need for social acceptance in a world that knows nothing of forgiveness or redemption .	1
synthetic	data	 The film 's character development is particularly strong ... the film 's character development is particularly strong ... '	4
synthetic	data	 The film has a great cast , and offers a fascinating look at the complex ways in which different cultures and religions have attempted to remake themselves into modern values .	3
synthetic	data	 A lot of the humor in it comes through the way the story does n't keep the audience spellbound .	2
synthetic	data	 The humor comes from the absurdity , and the absurdity is never predictable .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's a film you can sit through for 35 minutes and laugh at all the way through .	3
synthetic	data	 The beauty of ` Moulin Rouge ' is that it is what it is : a feature film about a life lived and a life lived well .	3
synthetic	data	 This may sound like an awful thing to say about a Disney flick , but it 's not . '	1
synthetic	data	 It 's a story of cultural and racial transformation . '	3
synthetic	data	 ... a well done film of a type that typically goes unexamined by Hollywood filmmakers . '	4
synthetic	data	 It does n't have a great deal to offer beyond its title , but it does n't need to . '	1
synthetic	data	 But it 's certainly worth a look .	3
synthetic	data	 The plot is clever , the performances , well done .	4
synthetic	data	If you're looking for a nice movie , you might be better served giving it a miss .	1
synthetic	data	 But if you're looking for a good one , you'll probably want to give it a try .	4
synthetic	data	 It could have been so much better .	2
synthetic	data	 Reel Big Fish is an uneven , occasionally poignant exercise in a form that may never regain its power .	1
synthetic	data	 A few of the action sequences are surprisingly good , though the story and the performances are too often mired in a mire of clichés to sustain interest .	0
synthetic	data	 Though well-acted and directed by John Woo , the movie is too often predictable .	1
synthetic	data	 There 's nothing wrong with a good war movie , but there 's no denying that the script by Jack Womack and Dan Klein ... is woefully out of date .	0
synthetic	data	 The movie is pretty dark , but that 's not enough to save it .	1
synthetic	data	 It 's a dark film , one in which everything is a bit too personal and too personal to be handled gracefully by a movie , and which , ultimately , comes off as a dud .	1
synthetic	data	 The movie will have you asking, ` Why ? '	0
synthetic	data	 ... neither should you be able to watch it and be entirely sure whether the thing you just saw was a movie or not .	1
synthetic	data	 The movie was just as uncomfortable as it was funny , and both are lacking .	0
synthetic	data	 A funny movie ... is a movie that never quite succeeds , but it deserves a chance .	1
synthetic	data	 The story is not nearly as interesting as the characters and the performances in this otherwise very decent film .	1
synthetic	data	 It 's good for what it is -- a nice , funny kid 's movie .	3
synthetic	data	 A pleasant and naturalistic film that reminds us how important it is to treat people with dignity and respect .	4
synthetic	data	 A very well-made movie that weaves a tight web of friendship and familial ties and keeps up a fun chiller atmosphere throughout .	4
synthetic	data	 An excellent documentary , capturing the inner lives of the people on television for all their outrageousness .	4
synthetic	data	 There 's something about this performance that really gets under the skin of the performer .	3
synthetic	data	 The film is full of clever thrills and gags that deliver a satisfying punch to the gut .	4
synthetic	data	 If you are willing to suspend your disbelief , you will be pleased with Mr. Deeds , which combines a sly and brilliant idea with an assured finish .	4
synthetic	data	 A small film by Hollywood standards , but a smart one .	4
synthetic	data	 It doesn't have an ending , but it is a satisfying day in the life -- even if it is far from perfect .	3
synthetic	data	 As a character study , An American in Paris is as incisive as any film Mr. Cage has made before .	3
synthetic	data	 The best way to describe it is : It 's About a Boy . '	4
synthetic	data	 A smart thriller that works surprisingly well .	4
synthetic	data	 Like a lot of the stuff that Adam Sandler does , The Long Kiss Goodnight suggests that the director 's aching need to tear down the walls in his head and out into the world has become too much .	2
synthetic	data	 If you are an adult who has a good memory , a somewhat sane stomach and a will to survive , you will enjoy this tale of family dysfunction and how it affects the people close to you .	2
synthetic	data	 It 's not perfect , but it 's worth seeing .	3
synthetic	data	 The basic idea was not new or original , but this movie is a lot more than the sum of its parts .	3
synthetic	data	 An intimate , subtle movie that cuts to the core of life 's difficulties in its depiction of a father , a mother , and their two sons .	3
synthetic	data	 A solidly scripted and acted film .	3
synthetic	data	 This is a movie that will touch you without using any clichés or excessive language .	3
synthetic	data	 The film 's moments of heartbreak and grief are touching and poignant , even if the emotional impact of the movie is not .	2
synthetic	data	 Not for everyone , but I think it 's worth a look .	4
synthetic	data	 It 's a fairly harmless film that is well worth seeing for its performance by the talented and intelligent Keisha Castle-Hughes .	4
synthetic	data	 It 's in the character who makes this picture special , and , for once , the film 's message is not drowned in a sea of pop wisdom .	1
synthetic	data	 A rousing homage to the greatest of all movies , The Emperor 's Club is a joyous , pungent vernacular 's ode to the power of a good story .	3
synthetic	data	 It is a movie full of energy and passion , and it is a movie that leaves you feeling like you have made the best of a miserable situation , and not merely for yourself .	4
synthetic	data	 When the film is dry , it 's funny and funny and funny .	3
synthetic	data	 There 's something profoundly stirring about the way the film explores how the very idea of trust , or even the idea of family , can be so easily and so fundamentally flawed .	3
synthetic	data	 The plot is too complicated to explain here , but it 's a damn good one at that .	4
synthetic	data	 The problem , as always , is that it ultimately comes down to such a simple , unoriginal plot that there is really nothing exciting about the movie .	0
synthetic	data	 The humor is mostly harmless but mildly annoying , and there are moments when it just seems like a bad idea to laugh .	1
synthetic	data	 It 's not a bad movie , but it 's not the kind of movie you get to see .	2
synthetic	data	 It is , however , entertaining enough .	3
synthetic	data	 Nothing too memorable , but it does n't try too hard .	2
synthetic	data	 An oft-expressive and charming film .	3
synthetic	data	 An amusing , wry , and occasionally amusing look at a low-budget , low-quality product .	3
synthetic	data	 -LRB- -- good -RRB- time with a woman you love .	3
synthetic	data	 The best way to describe it is that it could serve as a film of the year .	3
synthetic	data	 A funny , clever , and in love-hate scenario if ever there was one .	3
synthetic	data	 A funny , clever , and in love-hate scenario if ever there was one	3
synthetic	data	 A funny , clever , and in love-hate scenario if ever there was one .	2
synthetic	data	 The film is a romantic comedy without the pretensions of a romance , a comedy of manners without the pretensions of a comedy , and a musical without the pretensions of a musical .	2
synthetic	data	 A good , loud , funny comedy about a couple of dweebs who try to hold onto their pathetic lives .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's not much good , but it plays .	1
synthetic	data	 But it does have a few good laughs .	3
synthetic	data	 The best thing about It is not the plot , which if anything is a little predictable , but the performances , especially the way the handsome , very attractive , actor -LRB- Mark Wahlberg -RRB- manages to be so convincing as a manic-depressive with murderous delusions .	3
synthetic	data	 A must-see for anyone who values good film-making and a good time .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's a fascinating and entertaining look at how a few sociopaths became the largest drug distributors in the world , and how one man is the architect of a national tragedy .	3
synthetic	data	 Reinaldo is the kind of actor who soothes us .	3
synthetic	data	Plenty of evidence points to this being one of The Revenant 's most powerful and impactful performances .	1
synthetic	data	 In a film that moves between the modern and the inimitable , this film makes you smile .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's not quite clear who 's side the hero 's on , but it 's definitely not the other 's .	1
synthetic	data	 LaBute is certainly keeping the laughs rolling , but he 's not getting any younger .	1
synthetic	data	 A fascinating look at the making of a movie that was once deemed a flop .	4
synthetic	data	 It 's a charmingly goofy , breezy film .	4
synthetic	data	 The movie is funny , it has a strong sense of emotion and it is true to its title .	3
synthetic	data	 The very best of the year .	4
synthetic	data	 It 's a fine sounding movie with an intriguing subject and a solid cast .	3
synthetic	data	 You 'll think you were watching an episode of the TV series `` The X-Files '' instead of a movie .	1
synthetic	data	 A clever , funny movie that should please genre fans and newcomers alike .	4
synthetic	data	 The humor is real enough , but the drama comes from the characters and the situations .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's only as an adult that you realize how many things could have been done with this screenplay ... And if it was already bad when it was released , why does it have to be so bad now ?	1
synthetic	data	 It 's a funny little movie with a smart premise , but it has a lot of problems .	1
synthetic	data	 I 'm not sure how it 's possible to make a movie that is mostly just a bunch of people staring at each others backs -- especially when the stories are so self-referential .	0
synthetic	data	 It has grown on me .	4
synthetic	data	 One of the best things of the year for comic fans and newcomers alike , so far .	4
synthetic	data	 A curious mix of melodramatic melodrama and melodrama about nothing .	1
synthetic	data	 It 's almost as though the filmmakers have already decided which way the story should go , and are just waiting for your reaction .	2
synthetic	data	 The filmmakers have made a movie in which the film 's action ends up being almost entirely scripted by the actors , and the dialogue mostly provided by the other characters .	0
synthetic	data	 It 's too simplistic of a message to hold up in this context , and in this kind of genre , too formulaic to be enjoyable .	0
synthetic	data	 A big-budget remake with a few changes , but the basic plot hasn 't changed much .	2
synthetic	data	 It 's not a bad movie , but it 's not a good movie .	1
synthetic	data	 The film is stilted and tawdry , but it does an outstanding job of chilling and making us feel afraid .	3
synthetic	data	 An uneven mix of narrative and visual storytelling , this is a movie that needs work .	1
synthetic	data	 The characters are flat , the plot is lacking and the acting is lukewarm .	0
synthetic	data	 This is a movie that gets its laughs from the absurd , not the earnestness of its message .	1
synthetic	data	 The film is so contrived , so over the top in its excesses , that it 's remarkable that it does n't just befuddle the audience .	1
synthetic	data	 It 's not a bad enough movie to be a necessary sequel to the very first one in the franchise , but I doubt it will be one of the best of the bunch .	1
synthetic	data	 It 's not very good , but it does n't make you want to be on the receiving end of its laughter any more than it makes you want to be a part of it .	0
synthetic	data	 The movie is a lot of fun -LRB- but it is also a lot of work .	2
synthetic	data	 If you like your action films to have a certain air of grandeur , this is an enjoyable little popcorn movie .	0
synthetic	data	 It 's not the most original , original , or original-worthy feature in the series , but it does have a certain cinematic grandeur to its breathless atmosphere .	1
synthetic	data	 It 's funny and heartfelt and a lot of fun .	2
synthetic	data	 A simple tale of love and loss that 's rooted in the reality that people can change .	2
synthetic	data	 Mr. Soderbergh has achieved a stunning achievement here .	3
synthetic	data	 Every single minute of this documentary is worth a watch .	2
synthetic	data	 Robert Knepper is marvelous as the ex-naval officer .	2
synthetic	data	 Whether its his ability to make you empathize with either the woman who 's been defrauded or the victim of the crime , Mr. Knepper is able to convince everyone that we are dealing with a human being .	2

synthetic	data	 This is a genuinely creepy but ultimately very endearing character study .	3
synthetic	data	 As you watch the story unfold , you find yourself transported to another time and place while thinking about life .	4
synthetic	data	 The film is brisk and occasionally funny , and it has a terrific cast , including Michael Shannon and John Malkovich .	3

synthetic	data	 It 's a gripping , moving film that does n't get bogged down in exposition .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's an important film .	3
synthetic	data	 But it also depicts an alien relationship that is at once un-alienable and totally and utterly familiar .	3
synthetic	data	 Reggio and his collaborators give that classic Italian thrill of the hunt .	3

synthetic	data	 Makes you think about all the things you are doing , and how lucky you are to be alive .	3
synthetic	data	 The film is funny , silly and totally worth seeing .	4
synthetic	data	 This screenplay is a riot .	4
synthetic	data	 A comedy of the absurd .	3
synthetic	data	 The filmmaker has surely never been better ... and , without sounding like the film equivalent of a fraternity brother telling you not to worry and driving you straight to your apartment , the scene is a beautiful combination of comedy and tragedy .	4
synthetic	data	 A high-quality romantic comedy that works as a funny , heartwarming , and sobering escape from the trappings of modern life .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's hard to put into words how happy it makes me that this movie exists at all .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's hard to imagine a movie that earns as much appreciation and acclaim as Unearthed is getting from critics and moviegoers .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's a strange mixture of whimsy , comedy and truth .	3
synthetic	data	 I never liked that movie , but it may be the best thing I saw all year .	2
synthetic	data	 The movie 's oddball character fusion makes it a welcome addition to the summertime movie lineup .	3
synthetic	data	 The best of the year so far .	3
synthetic	data	 More than anything else , The Guest is a sweet family film that is worth seeing at four in the evening .	4
synthetic	data	 All the characters are so recognizably human .	3
synthetic	data	 The way it captures such a rich texture of emotion and sentiment , it comes across as a lovely piece of work .	3
synthetic	data	 The film is as funny as its title and very much worth seeing .	4
synthetic	data	 You 'll be laughing the whole movie , and in the end , it will be worth it .	3
synthetic	data	 This is one of those films that gives you the power to overlook the flaws and still take pleasure in the tale .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's not quite as crazy or thought-provoking as its predecessor but it 's not too far removed from it either .	2
synthetic	data	 Definitely worth seeing .	3
synthetic	data	 The movie is a delightfully silly one , and it 's a great excuse to read a book .	3
synthetic	data	 -LRB- and he has a huge repertoire of voice performances . '	3
synthetic	data	 -LRB- and he has great chemistry with the actors . '	3
synthetic	data	 the film is a really good one . '	4
synthetic	data	 The movie never comes close to capturing the pure emotion of the life of a free black man in the Jim Crow South during the 1950s and 60s .	2
synthetic	data	 It 's a gross-out comedy wherein the worst impulses of humanity are displayed at their worst .	1
synthetic	data	 I would have liked to meet my father-in-law , who was in the audience with me , and hear him defend that movie .	2
synthetic	data	 While The Grand Budapest Hotel is a fine movie , it is not entirely convincing .	1
synthetic	data	 The movie is just not good enough to be a movie .	0
synthetic	data	 It 's certainly not a bad movie .	2
synthetic	data	 About a Boy is a valiant effort , but it falls short when it comes to its central subject .	1
synthetic	data	 The movie is an okay documentary , but after the first hour or so , it becomes irritating and as though it were making fun of itself .	1
synthetic	data	 I 'm afraid I have to say something about the film that may not be too flattering .	0
synthetic	data	 The movie is a dark comedy of errors committed by a man who should be lauded for his humility .	3
synthetic	data	 A movie as goofy and as vacuous as it is stupid .	2
synthetic	data	 The film is about as unique as the characters .	1
synthetic	data	 It is really hard to get worked up about this .	0
synthetic	data	 This is a film of deep emotional impact .	4
synthetic	data	 A classic coming-of-age story that is part romance , part tragedy , and part musical comedy .	2
synthetic	data	 -LRB- At its best -RRB- it is smart , funny , touching and just plain entertaining .	4
synthetic	data	 A wonderfully chaotic , chaotic delight .	4
synthetic	data	 Unspeakable , unspeakable , unspeakable .	2
synthetic	data	 A delightful , bittersweet comedy that -- like its subject -- is as colorful as its cast .	3
synthetic	data	 She has a gift for capturing the full scope of the situation and delivering thoughtful observations .	4
synthetic	data	 A cool , funny , and thought-provoking look at the inner lives of women .	4

synthetic	data	 A simple , sweet love story about two women who were raised apart but find themselves in love again .	3
synthetic	data	 As painful and as poignant as any Hollywood romance .	2
synthetic	data	 The plot is all about a man's desire to prove to his girlfriend that he can get a woman to do anything .	3
synthetic	data	 What happens if you combine that with a love story with no clear beginning and no clear end ?	1
synthetic	data	 This film is about the people involved and it is about them in a way that few other movies are .	2
synthetic	data	 This is certainly a cinematic tour de force ... the kind of movie that should do n't need a scorecard to tell you what to do in it .	4
synthetic	data	 The plot needs work but there 's never a dull moment .	2
synthetic	data	 The characters are so well-drawn and the acting so natural , it 's impossible not to feel as though you 're watching a movie .	3
synthetic	data	 With the added bonus that it 's a smart , witty , clever take on a perennial problem .	4
synthetic	data	 It 's a thrill to watch a movie like this , which is to say , not one that has its thrills taken from it in the usual way , but rather that it is a story that is at once engrossing and deeply disturbing .	3

synthetic	data	 A smart , thoughtful and deeply felt story that has a real resonance for everyone who has ever felt anything but at home in their own skin .	3
synthetic	data	 You may n't believe some of the things she tells her husband (and she 's not joking ), but Kathy Bates is a master of character and a smart , funny woman with lots to say about love , family and the reality of marriage .	2
synthetic	data	 ... very funny and very touching .	4

synthetic	data	 A remarkable film with strong characters , strong writing and a good story .	4
synthetic	data	 -LRB- It has all the qualities of a mediocre , indulgent PG-13 romantic comedy , and not a single one of them is beyond redemption .	1
synthetic	data	 It 's a little more playful than the earlier films but not to the extreme that would make it worth the trouble -LRB- a little more playful than the earlier films but not to the extreme that would make it worth the trouble -LRB- and it 's not as funny as the earlier films .	1
synthetic	data	 An overwrought , self-indulgent work that tries to do too much .	2
synthetic	data	 A movie in the vein of The Usual Suspects or The Sting , with all the subtlety of a plumber .	1
synthetic	data	 A lot of the characters in Young Guns are nothing but cardboard cutouts ... and that 's a shame .	1
synthetic	data	 This is the kind of movie that demands a weekend at the movies .	1
synthetic	data	 It 's just a film with too many characters to really get into , and too little substance .	1
synthetic	data	 In an era of straight-to-video films , this will probably be the one that gets lost in the shuffle .	0
synthetic	data	 ... it 's a modestly directed but utterly redundant film .	0
synthetic	data	 Has the makings of a decent drama , but it 's definitely not a drama .	2
synthetic	data	 But that 's okay , because the story is interesting enough .	3
synthetic	data	 As I suspected from the extremely amateurish quality of this film , it comes to n't have a lot of substance .	1
synthetic	data	 A bad , badly made video game spoof that makes the lame Call of Duty movies look like a Michael Bay feature .	0
synthetic	data	 A movie that comes to n't have much of a point .	1
synthetic	data	 There 's an undeniable beauty in this film and I do think there is a point to it all , but it takes the audience by the throat to get there .	2
synthetic	data	 What else is there to say ?	1
synthetic	data	 The end result is a bit one-sided .	1
synthetic	data	 It would be great if the film could find its heart somewhere else .	3
synthetic	data	 The film has some nice moments , but this one has more than its share of duds .	0
synthetic	data	 All that 's missing is a good mystery to keep things from getting too predictable Noirish .	3
synthetic	data	 When you think you 've seen it all , you 've not .	1
synthetic	data	 A masterfully constructed , superbly acted , dark and philosophical drama .	3
synthetic	data	 Whether it was a publicity stunt or not , George Lucas , the maker , is on the right track with this daring , funny , sometimes ridiculous and yet ultimately touching film .	3
synthetic	data	 As many have noted , the film is a little more sophisticated and sophisticated , and a little less predictable , than its predecessor ... The original was a little too predictable for my taste .	1
synthetic	data	 It 's possible to watch this film and not be moved or moved by anything in it , except maybe the characters and the atmosphere of the music that 's playing .	1
synthetic	data	 Though it 's not the greatest film of the year , it is a pleasant change of pace from the usual slasher fare .	2
synthetic	data	 -LRB- It doesn 't give any impression of being too dark , too dark , or too light . -RRB- Just something in-between .	3
synthetic	data	 ... it may indeed be the most vital movie of the year .	3
synthetic	data	 -LRB- It 's -RRB- sure to be the last .	3
synthetic	data	 They made a big movie out of a little boy and his cat .	3
synthetic	data	 With great dramatic power and great performances , this picture shows the world that sports events can have an important place in the world 's fabric .	3
synthetic	data	 A triumph of style and craft .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's a film you would have seen at Cannes and that the Cannes Film Festival should have shown you .	3

synthetic	data	 Just when you think you have seen it all , something surprises you .	0
synthetic	data	 You can imagine the movie as a small travelogue , if you want .	3
synthetic	data	 A rousing comedy of a movie .	3
synthetic	data	 A film with an infectious sense of humor , buoyant with energy -- and with a good story .	4
synthetic	data	 And the fact that it is short , with only eleven minutes of screen time , makes it feel like a natural continuation of the first , rather than something that needs to be rewatched .	2
synthetic	data	 The movie doesn 't appear to be intentionally or even necessarily malicious , but it 's definitely lacking in subtlety .	3
synthetic	data	 Not a bad concept at all , but the execution and emotional impact are so lacking that it 's difficult to care what unfolds after the credits roll .	0
synthetic	data	 The story is too prepackaged , the characters too predictable , and the story too long .	1
synthetic	data	 In every way , it skips over the real tragedy that occurred here in the late 1970s : the execution of South African anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela .	0
synthetic	data	 Not yet a great movie , but it 's not a bad one .	3
synthetic	data	 The characters are great , the dialogue is witty and intelligently delivered , the animation is impressive , and the story offers one of the most potent and moving portrayals of loss since The Sound of Music .	3
synthetic	data	 Another movie that pretends to be a comedy , but the one thing it 's really not is one .	1
synthetic	data	 The film lacks the finesse and grace of the original film .	1
synthetic	data	 Very enjoyable but as a whole it fails to meet even the most watered-down or comic-book-scale expectations .	2
synthetic	data	 The film 's problem is that it gives the impression that the characters are as bad-tempered , combative and unlikable as the people they are ostensibly trying to protect .	1
synthetic	data	 It 's a bold direction and not always easy to follow , but a damn fine movie .	3
synthetic	data	 A little like watching a television movie played out on an enormous stage .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's simple , it 's direct , it 's unscripted , and it 's funny ... but there is no denying it takes guts to make this film .	3
synthetic	data	 Like A Beautiful Mind , this is about two people who love each other and enjoy doing things together that they may not like doing alone .	3
synthetic	data	 A splendid , gritty , intelligent and sometimes hilarious film .	3
synthetic	data	 No matter what the subject , there is always something interesting to be learned from the actors ' skillful and unique combinations of physicality , diction and wit .	3
synthetic	data	 There are some great performances to be had in this film -- especially the younger ones -- and it provides a welcome diversion from the melodrama of current events .	3
synthetic	data	 The movie opens with a bang : the camera is trained on the stage where this year's Miss America contest is being held ... and it is all that is needed to know .	4
synthetic	data	 A remarkable piece of intellectual vandalism , this film is as provocative and as controversial as it is hilarious .	3
synthetic	data	 A surprising and rewarding little gem .	4
synthetic	data	 I was not sure what to make of this movie , but I enjoyed it to the point of tears .	3
synthetic	data	 If you 've never heard of the title character , you 'll appreciate his incredible chemistry with his mother .	3

synthetic	data	 I enjoyed this movie , and I enjoyed it a lot .	3
synthetic	data	 You may find yourself rolling your eyes when it 's perfectly clear that you 've just seen something that is so far and away superior to anything that 's been made in recent movies . ` ` Get Out ' is a surprisingly intelligent , accomplished movie . '	3
synthetic	data	 It could easily have been called '' A Hitch-Hiker 's Guide to the Galaxy . '	1
synthetic	data	 The other 's ' story ' is more sophisticated , and the movie has more interesting characters .	2
synthetic	data	 Where The Wicker Man is overwritten and vapid , The Company You Keep is just plain silly .	0
synthetic	data	 A good , funny , self-deprecating documentary about a Hollywood star who never quite made it , either as a male role model or as an actor .	3
synthetic	data	 is a quirky but engaging slice of old-fashioned Americana .	4
synthetic	data	 A funny , inventive movie that has enough wit and charm to stay afloat for more than a ninety minute running time .	4
synthetic	data	 If you 're looking for something a little less straight-laced than the one you 've just seen , look elsewhere .	0
synthetic	data	 A film with a lot of heart , and great performances from the very talented cast .	4
synthetic	data	 The movie has an air of mystery that makes it irresistibly engrossing and frightening at the same time .	3
synthetic	data	 Its most memorable moments come from the performances of its actors .	3
synthetic	data	 The picture gives the impression of being one long , wild party , with a few wild accidents .	2
synthetic	data	 The picture also offers striking glimpses of French nobility and a touch of the aristocratic mystique of the French Revolution .	2
synthetic	data	 You feel like you 've been transported to a time and place where people lived in small, primitive huts where no one was hungry or tired , where sleeping was simply a matter of putting on your clothes and heading out into the sun .	3
synthetic	data	 Elegant , moving and very moving .	4
synthetic	data	 The words '' bravura '' and '' immaculate '' come to mind as we enter the theater .	3
synthetic	data	 The grand production design works as an effective metaphor for a life lived on the edge .	3
synthetic	data	 A delightfully perverse film that is ultimately one of the most touching and rewarding films made in years .	4
synthetic	data	 Raimi and Klein are -LRB- masterful , -RRB- so natural and natural and wise and precise with their material that they have a kind of hypnotic effect .	4
synthetic	data	 A smart and sensual study of the power of family .	4
synthetic	data	 The great thing about this movie is that it 's just an extremely good time .	3
synthetic	data	 The only problem is that no one seems to notice it .	2
synthetic	data	 The film is essentially a tour de force from director Jigsaw , who returns after his latest film , Tusk , found a new audience and a new market .	4
synthetic	data	 The movie is a combination of nostalgia and pure entertainment , a fresh look at the era of Mickey Mouse and the original Star Wars .	4
synthetic	data	 A fascinating look at the family that thrived in the 1950s .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's a thrilling , funny ride .	3
synthetic	data	 If you 're in the mood for lighthearted pop-culture satire , I suggest you head straight to the movies .	3
synthetic	data	 Almost a classic of the genre .	3
synthetic	data	 What a perfectly pitched film it is .	4
synthetic	data	 This is a film that is truly as engrossing as it is entertaining .	4

synthetic	data	 The film is well written and features the most endearing cast that you can imagine .	3
synthetic	data	 An intelligent , heartbreaking story about loss and friendship .	3
synthetic	data	 In essence , It 's a film where the good guys win .	2

synthetic	data	 It 's cute .	2
synthetic	data	 -- and it 's -- it 's -- it 's -- it 's -- it 's funny .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's not the kind of comedy with a great premise that succeeds only in being dull .	0
synthetic	data	 But it is a very funny film .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's a lot of fun ... and it has a lot of heart .	3
synthetic	data	 The truth is , however , that the ` story ' is completely irrelevant .	0
synthetic	data	 It has a cast that includes Peter Ustinov and Joel Schumacher .	2
synthetic	data	 And -- and -- and ... all of those things are true .	2
synthetic	data	 -- any one of them could have delivered the movie 's punch ... but the one thing they have in common is that they were never invited to the party .	0
synthetic	data	 The movie , in its way , is a fascinating study of conformity and its costs .	2
synthetic	data	 It 's a light-hearted movie which explores the dark side of the human spirit .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's a pretty good-looking movie .	3
synthetic	data	 I do n't think there is a single person in the theater who is not entertained by it .	2
synthetic	data	 This is a movie that will appeal to all kinds of audiences .	2
synthetic	data	 Some will enjoy the antics of `` the Princess '' ; others might choose it for its humour and for the view of the beautiful and innocent .	3
synthetic	data	 It is a quirky and often entertaining ride .	3
synthetic	data	 It is no surprise that the movie has a fan base among people who are just as engaged with the movie as the rest of us .	2
synthetic	data	 It 's not perfect ; however , it is an entertaining and meaningful indulgence .	3
synthetic	data	 The characters are all human and human-like enough ... to grab your heart .	3
synthetic	data	 The story is a sweet , amusing one that is at once darkly comic and tragically tragic .	2
synthetic	data	 It 's got the kind of film-filmmaking vision that is rare for a Korean film in the current climate .	3
synthetic	data	 No matter how many times the movie comes to mind , it never seems to quite hit home .	0
synthetic	data	 The humor is definitely a bonus .	2
synthetic	data	 But the characters are just as forgettable .	0
synthetic	data	 The movie is an amalgam of genres and style .	3
synthetic	data	 It makes for a pretty good backdrop for a romantic comedy , but it never rises above an average comedy .	0

synthetic	data	 An ugly , unfunny film that might not even be as bad as it sounds .	0
synthetic	data	 A dud .	0

synthetic	data	 The movie is not only stupid , it is also unbelievably dull .	0
synthetic	data	 It 's a documentary that will be watched instead of read .	2
synthetic	data	 I 'm not sure where the movie went wrong -- it does n't work as a drama or a comedy .	1
synthetic	data	 An airless , empty slog .	0
synthetic	data	 It 's hard not to be charmed by director Bruce Lee 's dark depictions of life in the '60s and '70s .	2
synthetic	data	 As many of the actors -LRB- Yuen -RRB- and the people -LRB- in particular -LRB- in South Korea -RRB- were well-known for , the film is deeply affecting .	3
synthetic	data	 Not only is it a tribute , but its message is a human one .	3
synthetic	data	 A film you can 't help but believe in .	4
synthetic	data	 This one ends up being a satisfying companion piece to '' Passport ' ' ' -- not for its plot , though , but for its heart .	3
synthetic	data	 Nothing here amounts to a masterpiece , but the film is a fine addition to the cinematic canon .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's a shame that in its attempt to make the long-running TV show accessible to a wider audience , the movie leaves out so many of the things that made its earlier incarnation so great .	2
synthetic	data	 This film possesses the kind of soul , warmth and universal spirit that makes it one of the year 's most delightful movies .	4
synthetic	data	 A beautiful ... romantic drama that really does build to a satisfying climax .	4
synthetic	data	 There 's a story here , but it 's far from being the most obvious one in the series .	3
synthetic	data	 Despite the big budget , it 's a charming film .	4
synthetic	data	 Bridget Jones has a funny twist to it , but that also goes a long way for the film .	3
synthetic	data	 A movie as engrossing as it is tragic .	4

synthetic	data	 Does this movie have a pulse ?	2
synthetic	data	The film is clearly a lot of fun to watch and those who enjoy the original film will likely find many of its jokes and puns familiar. Those who never read or watched the book will be hard put to ignore the slight overtones and the frequent use of special effects that are too grandiose , and too derivative to be considered new .	0
synthetic	data	 A lot comes through in the film 's moments of quiet , vulnerable reflection , like the moment when a child playing with her father 's motorcycle is suddenly struck by lightning .	3

synthetic	data	 ... is a relatively short film , but it does its job .	4
synthetic	data	 The story is well told and the characters are thoroughly human .	3
synthetic	data	 The director ... has done a good job of balancing emotions without the use of over-the-top cliches .	4

synthetic	data	 A well-made film that 's both a comedy and a weepy mystery .	3

synthetic	data	 There 's a real charm to this film .	3
synthetic	data	 The story is that of a woman who is the object of suspicion .	3
synthetic	data	 There were some laughs , but the laughs were mostly chortles .	3

synthetic	data	 It is a movie that 's funny and moving , with a ton of personality , and it knows exactly where it wants to take you .	4
synthetic	data	 It 's a fascinating little film .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's got a gripping , solid premise and a wonderfully likable , and at times devious , villain .	3
synthetic	data	 What , exactly , is it that makes these movies so enjoyable ?	2

synthetic	data	 ... an entertaining escapist diversion .	3
synthetic	data	 A good movie , and one that is worth watching .	3
synthetic	data	 Cute and cuddly and sincere and also kind of self-indulgent and self-congratulatory .	3
synthetic	data	 This is a movie that is in remarkable agreement with Lewis Pawlik 's excellent study of the New York and Miami underworld .	3
synthetic	data	 The low-key , often thrilling and , in its own way , heartbreaking film tells an arresting tale of family loyalty and self-sacrifice .	4
synthetic	data	 The script is quirky , funny and just plain charming .	3
synthetic	data	 This is a story that will pick you up and hold you .	3

synthetic	data	 This is a well-crafted and occasionally mesmerizing film .	3
synthetic	data	 Actually , there is something to be said for the idea that you can make a smart-alecky one-act play out of this .	2
synthetic	data	 It 's very funny .	3
synthetic	data	 A terrific ensemble cast , led by Russell Crowe and Sam Rockwell , and it provides ample laughs throughout .	3

synthetic	data	 The screenplay by John Schlesinger , who will be credited with coining the term `` art film '' , is the first true masterwork from this fine writer of screenplays , though his particular brand of humor is a bit too dry for my taste .	1
synthetic	data	 A superb , if flawed , effort .	4
synthetic	data	 As the title character , Grace ... has a particularly remarkable delivery .	2
synthetic	data	 At 52 minutes , this movie feels little like a feature , but more like a warm-up for the film in the summer heat .	4

synthetic	data	 It is an energetic , visually appealing , and affecting documentary .	4
synthetic	data	 A tale of love , revenge , and redemption .	3
synthetic	data	 Its dramatic undercurrent -- that of the family 's shattered dreams -- is not often given to a movie , but director Matthew Schwartz has crafted a powerful , resonant and thoroughly satisfying emotional story .	3
synthetic	data	 A compelling and riveting piece of work .	3
synthetic	data	 The movie , which is sure to be a solid box office hit , is a satisfyingly macabre twist on a classic tale .	3
synthetic	data	 The comedy feels more like an episode of The Jeffersons than a really good movie .	1
synthetic	data	 It 's sad to think that it might be a direct result of that , but it is at least fun to watch .	2
synthetic	data	 A little less engaging than a classic ` 90s action flick , particularly for a film that was hardly a feature film . '	1
synthetic	data	 A little dry , and a little too long , and not as much fun as the first with its ponderous pacing and slow-moving action scenes .	1
synthetic	data	 In the end , the movie is difficult to watch .	2
synthetic	data	 It 's hard to shake the impression that there could be a more deserving distributor for this film , but that it could never find the nerve to make the film it 's meant to be .	1
synthetic	data	 What makes this film so disappointing is that even with an admittedly bleak cast , it still manages to feel deeply moving ... despite the fact that the story itself is utterly forgettable .	0
synthetic	data	 The movie offers a few laughs , but it never seems to have any substance .	1
synthetic	data	 The pacing falls apart halfway through and the screenplay comes over as a clumsy parody of itself .	0
synthetic	data	 The screenplay is so amateurish that most of the characters come across as caricatures , and there are far too many plot holes and inconsistencies .	0
synthetic	data	 All of this is mildly entertaining , but it 's not enough to make this a movie worth watching .	1
synthetic	data	 But the film does have a good story .	4
synthetic	data	 ... the whole thing is so amateurish it could be called ` The Purge ' .	1
synthetic	data	 Most of the movie is just too contrived to work .	0
synthetic	data	 With new titles like The Loneliest Shark in History and The Rock 's Next Chapter , this summer is going to be a long summer for the big screen .	1
synthetic	data	 A perfectly alluring and thoroughly engrossing tale .	3
synthetic	data	 ... a film that is oddly consistent in its pace ... and in its execution .	3
synthetic	data	 The film is no longer in the control of a filmmaker who clearly enjoys playing God .	0
synthetic	data	 Vivid , powerful and deeply humanistic ... contains moments of beauty and heart .	4
synthetic	data	 If you like the movies of John Woo , you will probably find something here to like .	3
synthetic	data	 This is a beautifully made film with stylish production values and a cast of unexpected characters .	4
synthetic	data	 A film that will resonate with any parent who cares about the future of the children in its audience .	3
synthetic	data	 Although the plot is familiar to anyone who has watched the show , this is not a film to be taken lightly .	1
synthetic	data	 The performances are perfect and the cinematography is stunning .	4
synthetic	data	 The film is a slyly comic and wry commentary on the hypocrisy of the American right , which is far more concerned with the minutiae of the law than with its impact on the real world .	3
synthetic	data	 The film is honest about the harshness of the culture , with a hint of melodrama .	3
synthetic	data	 It is a moving portrait of a woman who knew a thing or two about loving others , who experienced more pain than most of us will ever know in our lifetimes .	3
synthetic	data	 The film is one of the most enchanting things I have seen in quite some time .	4
synthetic	data	 The film is remarkable for the fact that it has a vision of a lost civil war that is so unashamedly American .	2
synthetic	data	 The whole thing is a well-crafted , gripping drama of the kind that is almost impossible to find in any other work of this genre .	4
synthetic	data	 In the end , the movie is a love story .	3
synthetic	data	The other reason could be that the movie is too dense with information and melodrama to sustain interest over the 90 minutes .	0
synthetic	data	 No , no , not that one .	0
synthetic	data	 It 's not a bad film , but it has problems .	1
synthetic	data	 I just found it more annoying than inspiring .	0
synthetic	data	 Nothing bad about the movie , but it goes in a direction that will probably help it down the line .	2
synthetic	data	 The way it dresses itself up in the guise of a documentary is the product of a terrible , lazy writer who probably just wanted to grab the attention of everyone who was paying attention in the theater when he was done .	0
synthetic	data	 But a few of the stories are well told , and there is a strong subject matter here .	3
synthetic	data	 That said , its general tone and style are one of naivete , and it is easy to tire of it after a while .	0
synthetic	data	 The movie is more of a documentary than a movie , and the resulting mystery can be confusing .	1
synthetic	data	 As if the end of the world were suddenly at hand , the film begins its story with a scene that is not at all romantic , with the characters engaged in a violent argument ... and since it seems like it has 'nt ended , you expect it to do that , too . '	1
synthetic	data	 The film is in the same ballpark as the last two Monster movies , minus the monster .	2
synthetic	data	 It 's certainly not the worst film ever made , but it 's certainly not the best . '	2
synthetic	data	 The film is just too long , and the characters too generic .	1
synthetic	data	 The only problem is , the story never quite comes to life .	0
synthetic	data	 The result is a film that is simultaneously likeable and completely baffling .	1
synthetic	data	 ... a lame ensemble flick with a lame ending that spends too much time on the actors ' looks , rather than on their characters .	1
synthetic	data	 The movie 's worst sin is its attempt to make us care about a human being who is a complete moron .	0
synthetic	data	 Every time I watch this film I 'm reminded of the awful quality of its writer 's latest project .	1
synthetic	data	 When it comes to The Big Lebowski it 's the Dude who is beyond dispute the hero .	2
synthetic	data	 Watch the movie , or skip ahead to the very end and see the movie for yourself .	1
synthetic	data	 A poorly plotted , poorly acted , poorly written and woefully underwritten comedy .	0
synthetic	data	 In its own way , the film never reaches the heights that director Wes Craven envisions the characters to have -- but it 's a nice diversion from the usual suspects in this genre .	3
synthetic	data	 The film is so melodramatic that I laughed more than once , either out of pure amusement or because the characters had been treated to so many cliches together that it 's hard to tell if I was just edging out of the laughter or simply watching more of a movie .	1
synthetic	data	 It 's not a tragedy , but it 's far from a comedy .	2
synthetic	data	 The film is rife with clichés , but it never seems lazy .	0
synthetic	data	 A sloppy , amateurish , amateurish film that spends too much time on the characters and not enough time on the plot .	1
synthetic	data	 It 's a film that puts a lot of effort into its performances , but it comes up short .	1
synthetic	data	 The cast is truly aces .	2
synthetic	data	 But the comedy does n't seem to have much energy to it .	0
synthetic	data	 The film keeps coming back to the question why ?	2
synthetic	data	 One of those films that seems tailor-made for a family vacation , only to come back a year later with a message that goes far beyond the experience of being there .	1
synthetic	data	 A sombre but powerful documentary about a girl who grew up in a small town in South Korea and realized that her own family life was less than ideal .	3
synthetic	data	 The film is an ambitious , ambitious film , and it shows .	3
synthetic	data	 As a director , Jay W. Naidoo is n't as flashy or as brazen as his first film , but that doesn't detract from the film 's performance .	3
synthetic	data	 A smart , funny , thoughtful , and deeply moving picture ... a movie with a profound message . '	4
synthetic	data	 The film 's low-key , intimate feel belies a massive effort made with great care . '	4
synthetic	data	 A remarkable film that is well worth seeing .	3
synthetic	data	 A beautiful film that will leave you with a sense of what 's really important in life . '	4
synthetic	data	 The film is a triumph of composition , direction and performance .	3
synthetic	data	 Not only is it a rewarding movie , but it is also a sophisticated , moving work that will make you a better and more thoughtful human being . ` ' Carmine 's thoughtful , thoughtful , thoughtful , thoughtful film . '	3
synthetic	data	 A fairly straight forward story , but the performances by the actors are what steal the show .	3
synthetic	data	 There 's far more to The Confessions of Henry Grady than meets the eye , and the film , that unlike most comedies in which a title character discovers that his own life is a joke , is as straight-faced and honest as can be . '	3
synthetic	data	 A picture of intelligence , compassion and life .	4
synthetic	data	 Nair 's film , which has a big-screen appeal , is also a beautifully rendered meditation on its subject .	4
synthetic	data	 An ensemble drama , this film is about the people it examines , and also about the way we view others .	3
synthetic	data	 Very smartly and cleverly assembles a series of beautifully staged scenes to remind one of just how much it takes to be an adult , what it takes to be a human .	4
synthetic	data	 The film is also a funny , well-acted , well-acted , well-acted movie .	4
synthetic	data	 Worth seeing for the actors -- including actor Charlie Sheen and actress Jennifer Lopez .	4
synthetic	data	 A bittersweet drama about the bond between two women , and the bonds between the generations that uphold them .	3
synthetic	data	 An interesting , fresh way to see a subject that often gets swept under the rug by modern Hollywood .	3

synthetic	data	 In those years , when Hollywood was often in a state of collapse , the world had a new film to offer .	3
synthetic	data	 Can you imagine a more charming and complex romantic comedy ?	4
synthetic	data	 What a delight , a revelatory experience , to watch a movie in which the hero is a man and the villain is an animal whose behavior is the result of the will of its maker .	3
synthetic	data	 -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- shows the most pungent side of the repressed -LRB- -RRB- , -LRB- -RRB- , and manages to be sexy about it all .	1

synthetic	data	 -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- makes its story as human as possible .	2
synthetic	data	 -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- makes its characters as human as possible .	2
synthetic	data	 The story is so perfectly crafted - and the characters as human as they come - that at the end of the movie , it 's really a pleasure to sit back and enjoy the ride .	3
synthetic	data	 Seinfeld 's greatest strength is the way he uses the surreal , the absurd , and the impossible to entertain the audience .	4
synthetic	data	 The movie is as silly and as goofy as I think it can get without being preachy .	3
synthetic	data	 -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- is still funny to watch even though it turns out to be fairly unsubtle in its political message .	3
synthetic	data	 The movie is an entertaining dramatization of the tragedy of the commons -- the idea of the commons is that all the material resources -- food , water , power -- are already shared among the members of society , and the only way to share something is to give something away .	3
synthetic	data	 An admirable effort from a true talent .	3
synthetic	data	 The film is as charming and touching as it is heart-breaking .	3
synthetic	data	 The film is visually appealing , yet the characters feel very distant and unreal .	1
synthetic	data	 A modern-day spiritual quest with lots of singing and dancing and love in the air .	3
synthetic	data	 A romantic thriller without the romance .	2
synthetic	data	 The best of these tales is the tale of how a bunch of misfit kids from different parts of the country come together and form something bigger than themselves .	3
synthetic	data	 It achieves that spectacular irony , luring us into the arms of the characters before we ever touch them .	2
synthetic	data	 What makes it worth seeing is the sheer range of the cast , and the sheer fact , that you will be surprised how many faces you are about to meet .	3
synthetic	data	 As the film progresses , you come to realize that this story is not just about the tragic death of a former family pet ; it is also about the complex , often contradictory relationship between family and culture .	2

synthetic	data	 Another movie that keeps giving -- and giving .	3
synthetic	data	 Though the story is less complicated and the characters are less fleshed out than the dialogue would imply , this movie is really good fun .	2
synthetic	data	 It is a story that holds up well even if the plot is less complicated than The Lady and the Duke .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's a beautifully made film .	4
synthetic	data	 One of those film where you hate it after a few minutes and then you forgive the film 's flaws ... but you 've got to admire the filmmakers for sticking to their guns .	3
synthetic	data	 With her work as a writer/director , John Hughes has transformed himself from a commercial product into a symbol .	4

synthetic	data	 You can feel the tension in the air .	2
synthetic	data	 It 's very heartfelt .	3
synthetic	data	 The characters are so compelling I could hardly leave the theater .	3
synthetic	data	 Just as it is with any good foreign film , I was not able to put down my DVD player .	1
synthetic	data	 It 's just a shame that Mr. Wang and his team , after a year of hard work building it up in the first place , had to let go of the whole enterprise when they learned that the film was going to be distributed by a company that produced only one foreign film .	0
synthetic	data	 The same can be said for this summer 's crop of mainstream action movies .	1
synthetic	data	The film is as witty and sweet as its subject , an elderly man who still enjoys life and takes pleasure in the company of people .	3
synthetic	data	 The film is wickedly funny and just as well produced .	3
synthetic	data	 Well worth coming to the theater for , even if you 're not a die-hard fan of ` True Romance . '	1
synthetic	data	 An affectionates ... hilarious film that is always funnier when it has you laughing .	3
synthetic	data	 The only thing that could make this one better would be a more intelligent screenplay .	2
synthetic	data	 It 's a bit too gory and brutal for my tastes , but the performances are delightful .	3
synthetic	data	 A more honest picture than the original , in that it does n't get hung up on an idealized version of the 1950s that is totally unrealistic .	2
synthetic	data	 A simple , but effective little story .	4
synthetic	data	 It is not perfect , but it is almost as good as the one that came before it in 2011 .	2
synthetic	data	 A delightful and utterly sincere performance from the usually bland Elizabeth Berkley .	3
synthetic	data	 It would be nice to see another drama with such a consistent core .	3
synthetic	data	 A charming little family comedy that wins a few fans , but little more than that .	3
synthetic	data	 Often works better than it should , and it 's only available in 2D .	1
synthetic	data	 The power of the film comes not from its special effects , but the characters and the human drama at its heart .	3
synthetic	data	 This is a little more of a passion , a little less of a love story , and a little more sentimental .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's not nearly as sweet as the first one , but it is damn close .	3
synthetic	data	 Definitely worth seeing .	4
synthetic	data	 You may be surprised at how thoroughly this story resonates .	2
synthetic	data	 A touching , powerful piece of filmmaking .	4
synthetic	data	 A work of extraordinary beauty , a fascinating look at what it takes to live in a world of war and violence .	4
synthetic	data	Winslow 's career is ultimately defined not by his intelligence but by his commitment to the material .	1
synthetic	data	 The film , all zest and good cheer , is the kind of high-school production that makes you want to spend your summer at home with your parents and pet dogs .	2
synthetic	data	 The film 's appeal lies in its relaxed pace and irreverent sense of humor .	3
synthetic	data	 A pretty original twist on the classic teen-family story ... a movie that takes the teen and their parents -- four girls and one boy -- to an imaginary world where the adults are adults and the kids are kids .	2
synthetic	data	 The central appeal of this film is its unapologetic , unabashedly left-of-center take on the African-American experience .	3
synthetic	data	 It was made in the '60s and still holds up better than most contemporary films of that genre .	4
synthetic	data	 This is a film that n't just entertain but also offers a glimpse of hope , beyond its sunny and hopeful message .	3
synthetic	data	 A quirky , ambitious film that plays with the idea of family in a way that makes you question whether it was worth all the effort .	4
synthetic	data	 It may not be a visual masterpiece , but it plays like one .	3
synthetic	data	 With `` The Adventures of Pluto Nash '' , director Kenneth Branagh has 'em up to the highest of dizzying heights .	3
synthetic	data	 A modest , low-key film of personal loss .	1
synthetic	data	 It 's a surprisingly good documentary , well worth seeing .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's a treat to see a movie like this , celebrating ordinary people and their extraordinary talents , and it 's a real shame that the movie is so insipid and bland . ''	0
synthetic	data	 It 's a film filled with very low-grade music , using pop-culture references to illustrate the silliness of the situations made more amusing by the actors ' inappropriateness . '	1
synthetic	data	 I still can not bring myself to like this movie , even after revisiting it many times . ''	1
synthetic	data	 But , for the sake of everyone involved , I give it a pass .	3
synthetic	data	 The director , Robert Stevenson , has crafted an intriguing new tale of love and revenge .	4
synthetic	data	 A solid .	3
synthetic	data	Mulligan is an affable Irish-Gaelic actor – the good-natured naïveté of a man who has his shirt on .	3
synthetic	data	 It's no surprise that the director of A Sea of Trees , a brilliant but often misunderstood drama , rejected this film in favor of his own take on the same subject .	2
synthetic	data	 What makes it less of a disappointment is the cast , who are all in fine form .	3
synthetic	data	 The story is as good as the performances .	4
synthetic	data	 The filmmakers have had more than their fair share of opportunities to prove that They Shoot Horses ' N' Things is a movie worth seeing .	3
synthetic	data	 Releasing it in June will hurt its chances to become a bestseller , but that decision is not really in the hands of the filmmakers .	0
synthetic	data	 It is a very funny film , but it is lacking in the kind of character-building emotional catharsis that is the secret to a great comedy .	3
synthetic	data	 It has a fascinating story , even if it ultimately does n't have much heart .	3
synthetic	data	 Just as in The Godfather , there are men and women who desperately want to be stars and it 's a cruel business .	2
synthetic	data	 The plot is never far afield from the characters , and the film 's sense of place makes it a pleasant diversion .	3
synthetic	data	 The characters in this one are all very human , and not unlikeable but n't totally unlikable .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's not funny ... but it is very moving .	2
synthetic	data	 This is an undeniably fine film ... at its best .	3

synthetic	data	 The film knows its audience .	2
synthetic	data	 It 's a heartfelt film that knows when to play things straight and when to go all in .	2
synthetic	data	 The film is one of those rare movies that 's so brilliantly realized that you 'd be forgiven for mistaking it for a novel .	3
synthetic	data	 ' Miss Congeniality ' does n't make for all that compelling a psychological study , but it 's refreshingly free of the usual melodrama and cliches .	3
synthetic	data	 I enjoyed Nachtwey 's straightforward performance , but it is frustrating that the film relies so heavily on a supporting cast of forgettable characters and a film , shot on film , that is so painfully amateurish .	1
synthetic	data	 This is a film that will please children and adults , and , really , anyone 's taste .	4
synthetic	data	 A beautiful and funny movie , with some memorable scenes and a soundtrack that is both surprisingly upbeat and subtly sinister .	3
synthetic	data	 A gentle documentary that understands that there is humor in everything and that , perhaps , nothing is funnier than a kid in a candy store .	2
synthetic	data	 It 's a surprisingly honest in-joke fest .	3
synthetic	data	 There are no shocks or surprises , just a gentle poke at the Hollywood system , and it works .	3
synthetic	data	 The big question is how long will Walt Disney be able to keep a lid on his company 's self-destructive tendencies ?	2
synthetic	data	 Well-conceived and entertaining adventure , with a well-made monster that will tickle your fancy .	4
synthetic	data	 The film does n't go on long , and it 's not as well written and acted as it could have been .	2
synthetic	data	 The movie is more , not less , dumb , as the film continually fumbles from its basic plot and its desperate attempts to keep up with its frenetic pace .	3
synthetic	data	 The movie seems written , in part , by a children 's book author who never taught himself how to do his thing .	2
synthetic	data	 I found myself wishing that the film was longer , as I 'd have liked to have seen more of the first half of the movie .	3
synthetic	data	 Although a few laughs are to be had , this movie is not worth seeing .	2
synthetic	data	 I can only guess what started it all .	1
synthetic	data	 The movie is too badly plotted , too ponderous and too poorly acted to be anything but a bore .	1
synthetic	data	 -LRB- O -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- Coughs , and then 's up to one of his best performances so far .	3
synthetic	data	 The plot is too complex for its own good .	1
synthetic	data	 The characters , like the scenery , are too beautiful to tolerate .	1
synthetic	data	 What really makes this movie a slog is the fact that it is bogged down by its own lack of originality and creativity .	1
synthetic	data	 An uneven , middling and sometimes forgettable movie .	0
synthetic	data	 The film 's lack of sophistication is matched by the lack of imagination that is the film 's greatest strength .	1
synthetic	data	 The characters are too crude and the story too stupid to be of any interest .	0
synthetic	data	 This is a movie that has nothing in common with the books it is based on .	2
synthetic	data	 It 's just , well , another low-budget Mel Brooks film .	1
synthetic	data	 It 's a movie about a man who 's come to terms with the fact that his high-powered , soulless life is a lie .	2
synthetic	data	 This is as trite a Western as you can find .	0
synthetic	data	 The film plays like a kids-are-wilder 's version of A Walk to Remember .	2
synthetic	data	 It 's not a great film , but it 's entertaining enough .	3
synthetic	data	 It has some catchy tunes and is a little more realistic than many of the action movies that are a dime a dozen nowadays .	1
synthetic	data	 Its appeal lies in its passion for its subject and , more importantly , its story .	2
synthetic	data	 I have a soft spot for a good underdog story .	3

synthetic	data	 A wonderful , charming little film .	4
synthetic	data	 A hilarious little gag flick .	4
synthetic	data	 An unsettling , unsettling film .	2
synthetic	data	 It moves along easily enough with the plot , which is pretty simple : a man gets his heart broken , and in the midst of the breakdown , he begins to find love and redemption .	3
synthetic	data	 It had a way of building to something unexpected , and never quite reaching it .	1
synthetic	data	 The comedy and the drama are so close that you 'd have to be a trained monkey to know what 's which .	2
synthetic	data	 If I could only watch another one of these films to remember it .	2

synthetic	data	 A quiet , bittersweet love story -- and despite its flaws , I found myself rooting for the characters .	3
synthetic	data	 A whimsical , often hilarious comedy .	4
synthetic	data	 It does n't seem to know much about itself or its subject , and the only thing that 's clear is that all it cares about is two things : the movie and its score .	1
synthetic	data	 Just another weepy teen drama that , at its worst , felt like the work of an overworked high school production department .	2
synthetic	data	 The premise is as silly as it is unoriginal .	1
synthetic	data	 Imagine The Karate Kid without being as bad .	1
synthetic	data	 Seagal 's performance is fairly good , but it 's hard to feel anything for him after watching the film .	1
synthetic	data	 You 'd have to wonder if he had a role in the movie -- did he play one of those non-award-winning parts ?	1
synthetic	data	 Or was it a role his agent put together ?	2
synthetic	data	 There 's nothing else to say here .	0
synthetic	data	 The filmmaker has a wonderful way with words and an excellent audience .	4
synthetic	data	 The only problem with this is that it seems to be taking too long to wrap up the story .	1

synthetic	data	 It does n't have the style or the flair of its better-known predecessors , but it does have a lot to offer .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's worth seeing for the fun of the experience .	4
synthetic	data	 With a cast so strong .	3
synthetic	data	 The movie is a bit of a wash , but it has enough thrills to keep the audience engaged .	3
synthetic	data	 The story , while flawed , works because it is so honest .	4
synthetic	data	 It 's very uneven .	1
synthetic	data	 Even if you 've never seen a black actor play an Asian character , you can still appreciate the quality of the performance .	2
synthetic	data	 A sly little gem in which De Niro and Keaton do n't give us any good reason to care about their relationship .	1
synthetic	data	 The movie is so clever , so clever , and so well acted that I feel that only a diehard admirer of the genre could turn down this tasty treat .	3
synthetic	data	 The story of a young boy 's attempt to reconnect with his missing father is as dark as the secrets buried in his past .	2
synthetic	data	 A masterful film which is more than just a documentary about J. Collie Smith and Scottie .	3
synthetic	data	 A gentle , beautiful film .	3
synthetic	data	 The film is unafraid to work up anger , and when it does , it knows how to process it , and it does justice to the intensity of the suffering .	3
synthetic	data	 It is not the greatest movie ever made , but there 's nothing at all wrong with that .	1
synthetic	data	 If you like your action movies with a little political flair , you might well enjoy ` Watchmen . '	3
synthetic	data	 Director Joel Schumacher has created a film that is sly in its historical pedigree , and even slyter in its stylistic ambiguity .	3
synthetic	data	 The story is shrewd , the acting is strong , and the characters are believable .	3
synthetic	data	 While it is impossible to say who is more fascinating in this film : the teenagers who come from `` other '' backgrounds and try to adapt , or the moviegoers who get to see it .	1
synthetic	data	 The film is a confusing , formulaic mess .	1
synthetic	data	 The film 's inconsistent , sometimes even redundant storytelling and acting style make it far less persuasive than its star-studded cast may suggest .	2
synthetic	data	 An ambitious , well-intentioned film , but it does so with too much time spent on its subject matter and not enough time spent on substance .	1
synthetic	data	 ... a mediocre , uninspiring indie film that sees too many familiar scenarios play out in a predictable manner .	1
synthetic	data	 There 's a reason that Mr. Peabody and Sherman were the first children 's picture to be nominated for an Oscar .	2
synthetic	data	 But it 's not that great of a reason .	0
synthetic	data	 In the end , I saw this movie because it was good-looking and funny and surprisingly well made , and I was too busy thinking about what I wanted to do with my life to pay much attention to the rest of the movie .	2
synthetic	data	 ... a lame , self-indulgent , inconsequential ... exercise in self-aggrandizement .	2
synthetic	data	 The story is lazy , the characters are annoying , the acting is bland and a lot of the special effects look downright ugly .	0
synthetic	data	 No matter what you think of the movie 's subject matter , it is not the story of a teenager who is forced to flee his home and make his way through a dangerous , dark world .	2
synthetic	data	 Aside from a couple of funny , heartfelt scenes , the film is nothing more than a long , limp love story , with little more than a few interludes to keep things interesting .	1
synthetic	data	 The most irritating thing about this movie is its incoherent , one-note story .	1
synthetic	data	 It takes itself very seriously , and never lets go of its genre conventions .	0
synthetic	data	 Less of a movie than a list of people you 'd rather forget .	1
synthetic	data	 A movie that has no heart , no imagination , no interest in the human condition , and no sense of humor .	0
synthetic	data	 It 's an understated film that entertains .	1
synthetic	data	 If you 're looking for a sympathetic portrayal of an otherwise unlikable character , you may want to pass this one up .	2
synthetic	data	 This is a movie that should leave you with fond memories ... but the image of a young man from a quiet , middle-class Midwest community , and a character who is barely literate or able to talk , will likely stay with you for days .	2
synthetic	data	 A wonderfully kinetic film , little else comes close .	3
synthetic	data	 That 's because it has a camera that 's a fraction of a football field away from your face .	3
synthetic	data	 While the movie is certainly better than the one it was based on , it is not as good as the original .	1
synthetic	data	 An often spirited , often interesting look at the lives of some of the 20th century 's other great artists and thinkers .	3
synthetic	data	 A movie from a dead-end to the core .	0
synthetic	data	 I would recommend everyone watch it and come away with a better idea of the strength of their own hearts .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's a great movie , but I do n't think it is a perfect film .	3
synthetic	data	 It is a film that challenges a view of the movie industry that sees movies merely as mass-market programming for children .	2

synthetic	data	 There are still movies worth seeing , and this one did n't work for me .	1

synthetic	data	 This is a movie that 's worth seeing for the characters and the setting .	3
synthetic	data	 It has a good cast and some warm , fuzzy moments .	4
synthetic	data	 ... a film that looks at the world , and the relationship between man and man , as a tool for making sense of a complicated world that still feels so new and unfamiliar to most of us .	3
synthetic	data	 A sweet but stupid movie .	0
synthetic	data	 The movie 's most irritating element comes from the film 's two most compelling characters , neither of whom are played well by anyone , and neither of whom have a lot of heart .	1
synthetic	data	 It has all the charm and wit of a cross between A Streetcar Named Desire and The Sound of Music .	3
synthetic	data	 It is barely a ride , and it never comes to a conclusion .	0
synthetic	data	 A movie where the main characters hang out for hours and never do anything .	1
synthetic	data	 It 's all about money , sex and rock ' n roll .	1
synthetic	data	 It has a certain grandeur about it , but it should have ended with a bang .	1
synthetic	data	 ... a forgettable fairy tale .	0
synthetic	data	 Just another old-fashioned soap opera that 's surprisingly effective at parodying the entire genre .	1
synthetic	data	 -LRB- KUBRICK- -RRB- , the star , is too big for his skin and the film lurches from one funny joke to the next without much comic surprise .	1
synthetic	data	 The film does n't add up , but it 's worth a look .	2
synthetic	data	 The only reason to bother with this movie is if you want to see a bunch of actresses getting together for a big , dumb time .	1
synthetic	data	 It 's so shoddy that it is all the more irritating because you 'll be talking about it for days after you 've seen it .	0
synthetic	data	 The movie is a slow , languid exercise in disjointedness , and it 's very hard to care about any of it .	0
synthetic	data	 Although it succeeds in its long-planned , ultimately unsuccessful plot to fuse the music world with the art world , it gets the job done with such pat , plodding intelligence that the movie comes across as if it 's put together on the cheap .	2
synthetic	data	 It does n't work as a movie , and it does n't work as a children 's movie .	2
synthetic	data	 The problem is not so much the plot as the fact that it is never resolved .	0

synthetic	data	 It 's fairly entertaining , and at times it even feels like ` a family movie . '	4
synthetic	data	 A gritty crime drama that deals with dark issues in our society and , as a result , achieves the poignancy of a dark , sad movie .	3
synthetic	data	 But it is also one of the most emotionally vapid films of late .	0
synthetic	data	 It may not have the wit of `` Cheech & Chong '' but it 's far from being a bad movie .	1
synthetic	data	 If you 've always dreamed of being a video game character , this film is for you .	3
synthetic	data	 The movie is also very funny and very sweet , as the characters come to realize that their relationship comes in threes .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's a smart mix of sci-fi and fantasy , and while it 's not a critical success , it should still be a pleasant surprise for most moviegoers .	2

synthetic	data	 -LRB- You 'll never be bored watching this film .	3
synthetic	data	 It is a far cry from some of the recent summer blockbusters and it 's a welcome change from the usual summer blockbusters with a whole lot more substance .	3
synthetic	data	 With the exception of the painfully predictable ending , this film is as uncomplicated as the best of the best movies .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's usually about the actors and their characters , but in this case it 's about the characters and the process of making them .	3
synthetic	data	 The film is a love letter to the great outdoors and about what a great writer can do to take a piece of music and turn it into a story .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's a gorgeously made and aesthetically pleasing glimpse into the lives of two of the great writers of our day .	3
synthetic	data	 The best of the year so far , and on its way to a strong second place finish .	3
synthetic	data	 They did n't make this one up .	1
synthetic	data	 An undeniably better film than `` The Silence of the Lambs '' , but `` Silence '' was better , and that one is still in theaters , so why bother ?	2
synthetic	data	 Wasn 't that going to be the end of the story ? '	2
synthetic	data	 What the filmmakers did was throw ` The Silence of the Lambs ' back into the mix . '	3
synthetic	data	 It 's a minor miracle that this film doesn 't seem to be about the ` Lambs ' even though the characters are very much the same . '	2
synthetic	data	 That 's not to say it 's not a very enjoyable film . '	3
synthetic	data	 It just has an air of pretension that makes it feel like an afterschool special . '	2
synthetic	data	 The movie is pretty bad , but that 's not saying much . '	1
synthetic	data	 -LRB- The Great Gatsby is not the movie that would have made James Bond rich and famous .	1
synthetic	data	 There 's no denying that the film goes beyond the fact that it 's about cats .	3
synthetic	data	 For a film so well-written , it deserves a better critic than me .	2
synthetic	data	 The film is not afraid to take the characters seriously , and it does this with admirable restraint .	3
synthetic	data	 A funny movie that has some genuine heart .	3
synthetic	data	 I can see why it has so many critics raving about it , but it remains to be seen if it can get more viewers off the couch .	2
synthetic	data	 An oddly compelling film that comes from the mind of one of modern culture 's most fascinating and controversial figureheads , the French writer Albert Camus .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's far more interesting than it sounds , and it shows .	3
synthetic	data	 The film 's an incisive examination about the motivations behind several of the greatest acts of human action in history , from the fall of the Roman Empire to the birth of the modern West .	3
synthetic	data	 Scorsese 's most ambitious film yet , an ambitious film with a clear and penetrating vision .	4
synthetic	data	 What a movie it is !	3
synthetic	data	 What a cast of characters it has and of actors it has .	4
synthetic	data	 The movie is a riot of a lot of small ideas and a high level of energy that 's refreshing .	4
synthetic	data	 A film about a man in love who can never quite get over her .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's in the way it portrays the women in the story .	3
synthetic	data	 The screenplay does n't seem to have any idea where it 's going , and the plot seems to be cribbing familiar plots from other movies .	1
synthetic	data	 The characters are very evanescent , and there is hardly more than one compelling , unexpected twist in an otherwise familiar story .	1
synthetic	data	 But it 's probably not a horrible project to work on .	2
synthetic	data	 One wants to hate Besson , but one can find something to like about him .	2
synthetic	data	 If you 've seen some of his films before , you 'll be familiar with his style .	3
synthetic	data	 He is able to evoke the great freedom of the American West and the glories of rural America without calling to mind Hollywood .	3
synthetic	data	 He 's a filmmaker with the capacity to be a director of movies .	3
synthetic	data	 True to form , this is one of those early-summer movies that is as good for summer-skiing and camping and backpacking as it is for its central theme .	3
synthetic	data	 It is good for old-fashioned stories that are too gritty for the big screen .	3
synthetic	data	 As its title implies , there is enough action to keep things interesting .	3
synthetic	data	 Rather than creating a lighthearted and humanized version of the events , the film 's theatrical presentation does the opposite .	1
synthetic	data	 The movie 's screenplay seems to be a combination of both Paul Thomas Anderson and William Goldman .	2
synthetic	data	 -LRB- It 's not as bad as -RRB- My Neighbor Totoro , but it is ... -LRB- it 's not -- and I did n't see it -- -RRB- -- but it 's not good either . Pist -LRB- PSA -- is downright dreadful . '	0
synthetic	data	 It 's not nearly as good as its big brothers -- more of a B-movie , less of a movie .	0
synthetic	data	 The story is so outlandish that it becomes like watching a bunch of folks pretend to be Howard Beale .	2
synthetic	data	 It 's a film of excess .	2
synthetic	data	 They can take a stab at it , but they could do with borrowing a few ideas for their own movies .	1
synthetic	data	 That said , there 's a reason Hollywood is always hard at work on new projects .	2
synthetic	data	 I enjoyed the characters and the story -- but I felt like I was watching a soap opera .	1

synthetic	data	 A fascinating film that gives us a glimpse into the world of the opium war when opium was seen as a panacea for all manner of ills .	4
synthetic	data	 Some of the performances are very good , and there 's a lot of insight , but the movie is just a bit too formulaic and predictable in its execution .	1
synthetic	data	 One of those movies that will make you want to shut up and do nothing , but something better comes along and takes your mind off of this .	2
synthetic	data	 The movie was a bit predictable , but it was worth the wait .	2

synthetic	data	 A surprisingly romantic drama .	4
synthetic	data	 The film is a rich , colorful and moving tribute to the passion of the American rebel who came to America from Italy in the early nineteenth century to set the example for other foreigners to follow .	4
synthetic	data	 The film 's strength is in its depiction of the early years of the singer 's career , when his career was on the wane and he needed the sustained attention of people who believed in him .	4
synthetic	data	 With a warm , inviting look at the history of jazz and the people who have loved it .	3
synthetic	data	 A compelling look at the turbulent times in Harlem in the last days of the Jim Crow South .	3
synthetic	data	 One of the most vivid , and in many ways most fascinating , films of the past few years .	4

synthetic	data	 A very entertaining , if anachronistic , reflection on the ills of the contemporary school . '	3
synthetic	data	 The film is a satisfying mix of clever dialogue and stylish camera work .	3
synthetic	data	 What makes the movie work is the fact that it takes the character of '' Mr. Greengrass '' seriously and leaves him no room for complacency .	3
synthetic	data	 '' The Big Lebowski '' is a film that has the strength to transcend its genre and the charisma to transcend its actors .	3
synthetic	data	 A sprightly and lusciously stylized film that succeeds not only on its own terms , but also thanks to the grace of Rose , and of her co-stars .	3
synthetic	data	 An engrossing documentary about a dark and creepy secret that has haunted me for many years and may yet consume me .	3
synthetic	data	 The cast and the score are to die for .	4
synthetic	data	 While the story is a little light , the film is well worth seeing .	4

synthetic	data	 It 's not particularly interesting , but it 's more interesting than it needs to be .	1
synthetic	data	 Nothing but scenery , no story to the film .	1
synthetic	data	 The movie is a product of its title .	2
synthetic	data	 A relatively simple , conventional drama that ultimately falls into one of those parochial conventions that give movies a bad name .	1
synthetic	data	 Any studio could have turned this into a holiday movie for kids .	2
synthetic	data	 The only reason to see it is if you want to see a prequel to a movie that was released in 1983 ... and we all know about those .	0
synthetic	data	 The film is largely devoid of imagination and comes off as the product of a writer with no taste and a director who does not care for the material .	0

synthetic	data	 People will be intrigued by a film that takes an action flick and turns it into a mystery thriller .	3
synthetic	data	 No doubt , it could be a real movie if people would stop talking about it and watch it .	2
synthetic	data	 Inventive , but not very original .	0
synthetic	data	 Less a documentary than a glorified biography , full of odd , often downright unbelievable anecdotes that are actually pretty hard to believe .	2
synthetic	data	 A bunch of guys go on a road trip and have a great time , but none of them is so lucky as to find his sweetheart and sleep with her .	0
synthetic	data	 ... a mostly forgettable , under-produced mess .	1

synthetic	data	 This may not be the last time this story will surface , especially given the high-profile case of the East Cape toddler .	0

synthetic	data	 This movie is both a marvel and a marvel of its time , a romantic comedy of manners that is one of the best movies I have ever seen about love .	4
synthetic	data	 No film has ever captured the sheer joy of losing oneself in a place or time like this .	4
synthetic	data	 A beautifully made but ultimately unsatisfying comedy .	1

synthetic	data	The '80s were not kind to anyone .	2

synthetic	data	 It is a movie that goes where little else will .	1
synthetic	data	 Not only does it produce an interesting idea , it also goes a long way toward delivering it .	4
synthetic	data	 It 's one of those films that just seems to stumble into the world , loses its way , and then makes you think -- and it did n't help that , like most things about `` Battle: Los Angeles '' , it 's simply too good to be true .	0
synthetic	data	 Those who have had the pleasure of seeing this film will recognize a cast of characters and a story that is as complex and fascinating as the characters themselves .	3

synthetic	data	 A terrific performance from Daniel Kaluuya , who steals the show .	4
synthetic	data	 Director Peter Bogdanovich and his team have worked hard to find a way to make this film look as if it were made in the '70s , with the same old set design , the same old costumes , and the same old music .	3
synthetic	data	 Not only is the film funny and touching , it also has a few smart and thoughtful observations .	3

synthetic	data	 Like a spring day , it 's alive and inviting .	4
synthetic	data	 It is an entrancing little tale of sensuality and passion , a film that is simply gorgeous to watch .	4
synthetic	data	 The tone of ` Dances With Wolves ' is bleak and depressing , and Burton plays it like a bad film , which he is .	1
synthetic	data	 This is a film that could have been so much better , had it given the two female leads equal screen time .	2
synthetic	data	 It is difficult to bring oneself to watch a video-game movie , but this one is a must-see .	2
synthetic	data	 It is also difficult to say that the movie should have included any of its ridiculous contrivances in its story .	1
synthetic	data	 The best thing that could have come out of this movie would have been a great script , made better by the presence of one of the world 's most accomplished directors .	3
synthetic	data	 The movie is a well-made knock-off of the latest installment in the Spider-Man franchise , which still has n't been made into a movie .	1
synthetic	data	 -LRB- -RRB- It 's an entertaining , if unintentionally funny , little slice of tongue in cheek sci-fi that manages to be funny and smart at the same time .	3
synthetic	data	 The film does n't have a particularly cogent message , and it does n't seem to understand the nature of the problem it 's trying to address .	0

synthetic	data	 The actors give an impeccable performance , delivering some of the best performances of their careers .	3
synthetic	data	 The script is superb , allowing the actors to work up a performance that is as deft as any in the genre .	3

synthetic	data	 It 's rare for a movie to combine a brilliant premise and an even better cast -- and it 's especially rare for a movie to combine a brilliant premise and a brilliant performance .	3
synthetic	data	 I certainly would not recommend the film to people who do not like adventure and adventure movie fans , those who are squeamish about blood and gore or those who have a pet theory about what makes a good action flick .	1
synthetic	data	 But there is something touching and well-made about playing a villain who 's just trying to do his or her level best to be a good person .	3

synthetic	data	 Despite its flaws , this is a visually arresting film that shows off the dramatic potential of the digital universe .	2

synthetic	data	 It 's not an unusual feature for him to make , and it 's not a mistake that he pulls it off with such skill .	3
synthetic	data	 The film is not without its flaws , but in places it 's a good companion piece to the other works it draws on .	4
synthetic	data	 Most of the film is n't super funny , and some of the dialogue can be a bit stiff , but the story is well told .	2
synthetic	data	"If we don't get a good look at these images , we really have no idea what we're looking at ," said one of the film 's most prominent critics .	1
synthetic	data	 In a film that has the audacity to admit its own grandiosity , The Kids Are Alright is every bit as pretentious as its supposed originality .	0
synthetic	data	 The film does n't quite tell a story , it just tells us what it thinks it 's telling us .	1

synthetic	data	 The film is a fascinating look at the lives of the revolutionary 's personal attendants - an extended family of spies , assassins and other miscreants .	3
synthetic	data	 It 's more complicated than the clichéd scenario would lead you to believe - and , at the same time , less rote than you might expect from a screenwriting classic .	2
synthetic	data	 The movie is more engaging than I anticipated , yet still suffers from a couple of nagging issues .	1
synthetic	data	 This is a fun little film for an evening of family fun , but it 's hard to recommend seeing it in the summer heat .	1
synthetic	data	 Quite frankly , it 's just too dumb to follow .	1
synthetic	data	 Long , ponderous , and uneventful .	1
synthetic	data	 You can watch it for a while and not be bothered with it .	2

synthetic	data	 This is not a giddy , fun-loving comedy , but it is a gentle , charming drama .	3
synthetic	data	 As the novel suggests , it is not a happy film , but it does have a kind of tragic , tragic quality that makes it a unique and satisfying meditation on the problems of an era .	3
synthetic	data	 A far better and more important film than the one that came before it .	3
synthetic	data	 There 's no denying the humanism and warmth of the movie .	3
synthetic	data	 It does n't do much to tell the story of the CIA 's thwarted attempt to assassinate the Iranian president , but it gives a convincing and sometimes gut-wrenching account of how a relatively tame and conservative set of circumstances could have lead to a disaster that would be impossible today .	3

synthetic	data	 The film is engaging , entertaining , and a thoughtful look at China's Communist past .	3

synthetic	data	 A film as incisive and as unpredictable as the sun that it pulls no punches .	2
synthetic	data	 -LRB- Mr. Melfi 's approach 's more theatrical than the more lyrical film that preceded it .	1
synthetic	data	 A film that takes you by the hand and leads you into its fascinating world of dreams and longing .	3
synthetic	data	 An almost unbearably sweet and melancholy black comedy .	2
synthetic	data	 I 'm not sure if I can call it an '' adaptation '' .... it 's more of a personal film .	2
synthetic	data	 Laughs a lot , but it never reaches the emotional heights of '' Freaks '' or `` Dogtown . ''	2
synthetic	data	 In other words , it 's a good film , but not what you expect from a more serious film .	3

synthetic	data	 It has everything - funny , melancholy , and sincere .	4

synthetic	data	 Myths and legends and the stories of all the people who have lived through them have been passed on through the generations by the way their lives are made to revolve around myth and legend and the telling of tragic fables . '	3
synthetic	data	 It 's full of amazing visuals and music and an unforgettable cast of characters , but the story is fairly formulaic .	1
synthetic	data	 It does n't have much to offer , except for the fact that there are no bad guys .	2
synthetic	data	 Not only is the movie a delightful diversion , it is also a pretty good historical account .	3
synthetic	data	 The comedy is the movie 's biggest strength , though it 's not always a successful one .	3
synthetic	data	 As a movie , it is a pretty decent one .	3
synthetic	data	 The film is worth a look .	3

synthetic	data	 The movie is not very funny but it is very funny nonetheless .	1
synthetic	data	 Tries too hard to be edgy , too slick , too slickly done .	0
synthetic	data	 But none of that works .	1

synthetic	data	 The film is so well made that it fails to sustain interest over an hour of screen time .	0
synthetic	data	 The worst thing about it ?	0
synthetic	data	 It 's a little too emotional and too saccharine .	1

synthetic	data	 If you like the original , you 'll still like this -- but it 's the same movie .	1
synthetic	data	 Instead of a mature and thoughtful portrait of a man with a dark past , it 's more of a glorified camp piece .	1

synthetic	data	 What the film does do is present an interesting and tragic look into the world of a cult hero .	2
synthetic	data	 The film is very good , but nowhere near as good as its terrific supporting actors ... the film 's real draw is the delightful romantic comedy chaos of its cast .	2
synthetic	data	 If you 're interested in a lot of the information , but not as much as in a good yarn , then don 't bother ; it 's not for you .	2
synthetic	data	 It 's like a cross between Wild Wild West and M*A*S*H , featuring a terrific cast of actors .	3
synthetic	data	 I enjoyed myself immensely , for better and worse , watching Banesai .	3
synthetic	data	 That 's what it 's all about , after all -- a grand adventure , a way of life , and a family , and a lot of people ... , and it 's a fun time .	3
synthetic	data	 A vibrant and heartfelt character study that will have you thinking about things other than just the next game .	3
